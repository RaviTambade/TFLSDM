**AI Is Not the End of Software Engineering. It’s the Next Chapter.**

Every few years,
software engineers face an “existential crisis.”

“This is the end.”
“We’ll be replaced.”
“Our skills won’t matter.”

It has happened before.
Many times.

Recently, **Grady Booch** — co-creator of UML, Fellow at **IBM**, and a pioneer of software engineering — explained this beautifully.

Every time our industry moved to a higher level of abstraction, people panicked.

When:
- ✔️ Compilers replaced assembly
- ✔️ High-level languages arrived
- ✔️ Libraries and frameworks took over
- ✔️ Platforms simplified development

The same fear appeared:
“Programmers are finished.”

But they weren’t.

Those who understood **fundamentals** always moved ahead.


And now, AI has arrived.

Some leaders, like **Dario Amodei** of **Anthropic**, predict massive automation.

Grady’s response?

(Paraphrased politely) — *Complete nonsense.*

Why?

Because **coding is only one part of software engineering.**

The real work is:

- ✅ Managing complexity
- ✅ Balancing business & technology
- ✅ Making ethical decisions
- ✅ Designing scalable systems
- ✅ Building software that lasts

None of this is getting automated.



Today’s AI is great at:

- ✔️ Repeating patterns
- ✔️ Generating CRUD apps
- ✔️ Creating standard UIs
= ✔️ Automating routine code

Useful? Yes.
Enough? No.

Software is much bigger than templates.


### 🚀 His Advice (And Mine as a Mentor)

🔹 Stop panicking. Start thinking in systems.
🔹 The cost of building software is dropping fast.
🔹 Your imagination is becoming the real limit.
🔹 You can build today what was impossible last year.

That’s not a threat.

That’s a gift. 🎁

As Grady said:

You’re standing at the edge of something big.

You can:
❌ Look down and freeze.
✅ Or leap and soar.


At Transflower, we prepare learners not for tools… but for **thinking, designing, and leading.**

This is not the time to fear AI. This is the time to **master it and soar.** 🚀
