### LLD Low Level Design

High-Level Design (HLD) may get you started.
Low-Level Design (LLD) proves you’re a real software engineer.

Many candidates understand architecture at a surface level—but struggle when asked to model objects, define responsibilities, or write extensible code.

Here’s a **step-by-step roadmap to master LLD** and confidently crack real-world system design interviews:



### 1️⃣ OOP Fundamentals (Your Foundation)

Master:

* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

If your OOP basics are shaky, everything else collapses.


### 2️⃣ SOLID Principles (Clean Engineering Thinking)

Learn to write maintainable, extensible systems using:

* SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
* OCP (Open-Closed Principle)
* LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)
* ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)
* DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)

These are not theory—they’re interview gold.


### 3️⃣ Design Patterns (Applied, Not Memorized)

Understand *when* and *why* to use:

* Creational: Singleton, Factory, Builder
* Structural: Adapter, Decorator
* Behavioral: Strategy, Observer, Command

Interviewers care about reasoning, not definitions.

### 4️⃣ UML Diagrams Practice

Be comfortable with:

* Class Diagrams
* Sequence Diagrams
* Activity Diagrams
* Object Diagrams

Clear diagrams = clear thinking.



### 5️⃣ Real-World System Modeling

Practice designing:

* BookMyShow
* Uber
* ATM Machine
* Parking Lot
* Elevator System

Focus on:

* Object modeling
* Responsibilities
* Edge cases
* Extensibility


### 6️⃣ Interface & Abstraction Design

Learn:

* Loose coupling
* Interface-driven development
* Plug-and-play architecture
* Separation of concerns

This is where junior and senior engineers differ.



### 7️⃣ Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Develop confidence through:

* Unit testing
* Mocking & stubbing
* Refactoring safely

Good LLD supports testability by design.



### 8️⃣ Clean Code Practices

Avoid:

* Code smells
* God classes
* Tight coupling

Follow:

* DRY
* KISS
* YAGNI

Readable code wins interviews.


### 9️⃣ Dependency Injection & IoC

Understand:

* Constructor injection
* Setter injection
* Interface-based injection

Write systems that are easy to extend and test.


### 🔟 Build Portfolio-Ready Projects

For each system:

* UML diagrams
* Tradeoff analysis
* Scalability considerations
* Test cases
* Documentation

Don’t just “solve.” Engineer it.



### 1️⃣1️⃣ Practice Interview-Style Questions

Work through:

* LRU Cache
* Notification System
* Rate Limiter
* Tic-Tac-Toe
* Snake & Ladder
* Logger System

Explain your decisions out loud. Communication matters as much as design.



## LLD is not about writing 500 lines of code.

It’s about:

* Modeling real-world problems clearly
* Designing for change
* Thinking in abstractions
* Writing testable systems

Master this, and system design interviews become discussions—not interrogations.
