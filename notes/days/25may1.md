 
👨‍🏫 *Welcome to Object Oriented World:*

When I was your age, I too was trying to understand what this magical word *Object-Oriented Programming* really meant. At that time, internet was not in our pocket, YouTube was not there, and books were our only treasure.

In **1997**, I bought one book — *Object-Oriented Analysis and Design* (yes, the famous OOA&D book). The price was **₹800**. Now imagine, my father’s salary was around ₹3,000–5,000 per month. And out of that, I requested almost **₹700** for just one book! That was like asking today’s student to buy a book for ₹8,000–10,000. 😅 But trust me, that book **changed my entire perspective** about OOP.

📖 In that book, there were some *beautiful cartoons and diagrams* — not dry definitions, but **visual explanations**. I still remember them clearly, and I shared some with you today. Let me walk you through those, because they capture the heart of OOP.

 

### 🌟 Key OOP Concepts through Stories & Diagrams

1. **Modularity**

   * Imagine you have multiple boxes. Each box has its own things.
   * Modularity means *keep related things together*. Don’t mix.
   * Just like you don’t keep your toothbrush in the spice box, in software too, you don’t mix database code with UI code.

2. **Strong Typing**

   * Look at the cartoon where someone is trying to put a *round peg in a square hole*.
   * OOP languages say: “No boss! You cannot put an integer into a boolean.”
   * Strong typing protects you from silly mistakes.

3. **Concurrency**

   * Remember the cartoon with many rats frightening one mouse?
   * That is concurrency: *different objects working together at the same time*.
   * Just like multitasking — you are listening to me and also maybe sipping chai. ☕

4. **Persistence**

   * The cartoon showed a cat resting in the shade on a hot sunny day.
   * That is persistence: storing the state of an object so it can come back later.
   * Example: You save your game progress → switch off computer → come back tomorrow → your character is still at the same level.

5. **Object Definition**

   * Every object has **State, Behavior, and Identity**.
   * Example: *A Car* 🚗

     * State → red color, fuel = 50%
     * Behavior → accelerate(), brake()
     * Identity → its unique number plate

6. **Multiple Roles**

   * Just like one person can be a father, teacher, and cricket player,
   * One object can play multiple roles in software depending on context.

7. **Object Lifecycle**

   * Just like a human being:

     * **Born (constructor)**
     * **Lives (methods, state changes)**
     * **Dies (garbage collected)**
   * Rest in peace, object!

8. **Class vs Object**

   * Class is like a *blueprint*. Object is like a *real building*.
   * *Car class* → defines steering, 4 wheels, music system.
   * *Maruti Swift object* → has grey color, number plate MH-12-1234.
   * *Hyundai i20 object* → has red color, number plate MH-14-4567.

 

### 🌱 Then the connection to Software Process (Agile vs Waterfall)

Once I understood OOP, I realized software development itself is like building with these objects.

* **Waterfall** = fixed, rigid plan (like making a one-time painting app).
* **Agile** = flexible, iterative plan (like making an evolving shopping website where customer changes mind daily).

And in Agile, we have **Scrum, Sprint, Kanban** — ways to manage how these little objects (team members, tasks, features) move forward.

 

👉 That’s why I say: Don’t just read definitions of OOP.
Look at these cartoons. *Feel* the concept. Imagine them in your own daily life. Then you will never forget.

 👨‍🏫 *Mentor storytelling style:*

Students, I hope you are able to **see these diagrams and cartoons** I have been sharing. Aren’t they wonderful? They make such a **complicated subject like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** feel so simple and alive.

You know, I still remember clearly… back in **1997**, I purchased that famous book *Object-Oriented Analysis and Design*. The price was ₹800 — and at that time, my father’s salary was just about ₹3000–₹5000 per month. Imagine, I borrowed almost **₹700 from my father’s salary** just to buy one book! For him, it was a sacrifice. For me, it became a turning point. That book **changed my entire mindset** about OOP and software design.

And in that book, the author didn’t just write definitions — he used **cartoons, diagrams, metaphors**. That’s why the knowledge stayed with me for decades. Today, I want to pass the same feeling to you.

 

### 🌟 The Concepts with Stories & Diagrams

* **Modularity** 🧩
  Imagine you have a toy box. Inside, you keep only toys. You don’t mix in food or clothes.
  Similarly, modularity means keeping related things together and separating unrelated things.

* **Strong Typing** 🔒
  You cannot put a square peg into a round hole.
  In programming, you cannot put a boolean value into an integer. Strong typing protects you from such mistakes.

* **Concurrency** 🐀🐀🐀
  Think of many small rats scaring one big cat. They act *together at the same time*.
  That’s concurrency — different objects working in parallel.

* **Persistence** 🐈☀️
  A cat resting in the shade on a hot day until the sun goes down.
  That’s like saving the state of an object — so you can pause it and resume later.

* **Object** 📦
  Every object has:

  * **State** (data/values)
  * **Behavior** (methods/actions)
  * **Identity** (uniqueness)
    Example: *A car object* → red color (state), accelerate() (behavior), registration number (identity).

* **Multiple Roles** 🎭
  One person can be a teacher, a father, and a cricket player.
  Similarly, one object can play multiple roles depending on the context.

* **Object Lifecycle** ⏳
  Just like humans are born, live, and eventually pass away, objects too:

  * Created (constructor)
  * Live (methods called, state changes)
  * Collected (garbage collector cleans them)
    Rest in peace, object! 🙏

* **Class vs Object** 🏗️ vs 🏠

  * Class = blueprint (Car design)
  * Object = real instance (My red Swift car with number MH-12-1234)

 

### 🌱 The Bridge to Software Development Models

Now let’s zoom out. OOP teaches us how to design our code. But how do we design our **project process**?

* If the requirements are **fixed and simple** → Waterfall Model works (like building a paintbrush app).
* If the requirements are **changing, flexible, evolving** → Agile works better (like building an e-commerce site).

And within Agile, we have:

* **Scrum** → working in sprints with roles like Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.
* **Kanban** → visualizing tasks as “To Do → In Progress → Done”.

So just like objects can adapt, roles can change, and states can evolve, **software projects also need flexibility**.

 

💡 *Lesson:*
Books, diagrams, metaphors — they don’t just teach concepts, they **plant seeds of imagination**.
When you can see a cat, a rat, a car, or a person inside an OOP diagram, you will never forget what “object, class, persistence, or concurrency” mean.

 
 Rohit, listen carefully. Definitely, you will not be able to **use JIRA as a full-time tool** for your student project. Why? Because JIRA is a **subscription-based enterprise tool**. It works on a *pay-as-you-go* model. Large software companies like Visa, Pfizer, Cisco can afford it because they run multi-crore projects.

But we are **students**, right? Our goal is not to spend on tools, our goal is to **learn concepts**. So instead of buying JIRA, you should:

* Explore the **free trial** to get exposure.
* Understand the **basics of task tracking, assigning, collaboration**.
* Then, when someone asks you in an interview *“Have you seen JIRA?”*, you can confidently say:
  *“Yes Sir, I have tried the free version, explored its boards, created tasks, assigned them to team members, and tracked progress. We didn’t use it for the entire project because our project was only 3 months and the paid subscription wasn’t economical.”*

That’s the right answer.

 

🔑 *Now, why do we even care about JIRA?*
Because JIRA is a **project management tool**. It helps in:

* Defining tasks (To-Do list).
* Assigning tasks to team members.
* Tracking progress (In-Progress → Done).
* Following Agile methodologies like **Scrum and Kanban**.

But let me be clear — **your main role is developer**, not project manager. Your focus should be on coding, APIs, testing, deployment. Still, knowing JIRA is like having **extra polish** on your resume.

 

⚡ *Alternatives you can use for free in your projects:*

* **Trello** (also Kanban style, free for small teams).
* **Notion** (students love it nowadays).
* **GitHub Projects** (integrates with your code repository).
* **Microsoft To-Do or Planner** (if you already have Office 365 access).

All these give you the **same experience of task management**, without costing you a rupee.


📚 *And here’s the fun part we did today:*
Ashish volunteered, shared his screen, and signed up for the **JIRA Cloud free trial** using Gmail.
We saw step by step:

* Visiting Atlassian’s official site.
* Clicking **“Get it free”**.
* Choosing **JIRA Software (Project + Issue Tracking)**.
* Getting **10 free users** and **2GB storage** in the free plan.
* Creating a custom project space like *edac-icsd-2021.atlassian.net*.

That was a **live demo** of how companies set up their JIRA spaces. And now you know it’s nothing magical — just a cloud tool like Netflix or Prime, except instead of movies, you manage tasks.


💡 *Lesson for you, Rohit:*

* Don’t chase after buying JIRA for your project.
* Explore the trial, understand its features, note them in your resume.
* For your real project, use **free tools like Trello, Notion, GitHub Projects**.

That way, you learn **both coding and project management basics** — without burning your pocket.

Rohit, let me put this in a storytelling way so that you’ll never forget how JIRA works in a **real team scenario**.

👉 Imagine this:
We just created a **mini office** for our team inside Atlassian Cloud. Think of it like moving into a brand-new building, but instead of bricks and cement, it’s built with URLs and dashboards.

Ashish became the **landlord** — he registered the website, so his name is on the mainboard. But a landlord never works alone. He immediately invited three tenants — Shubham, Samriti, and Akshay. Each of them now has their **own key** (their Gmail login) to enter this office.

Now, what happens in this office?

* The landlord (Ashish) creates **rooms called tasks**:

  * Room 1: *“Create UML diagrams for online shopping”*
  * Room 2: *“Create ER diagrams for online shopping”*
* On every room’s door, Ashish sticks a label: **priority** (High, Medium, Low).
* And he hands over the **keys to specific tenants** — “Shubham, this room is yours. You are responsible.”

That’s what we saw when Ashish clicked **Create → Task → Assignee → Shubham**.

Now, the magic part. ✨
When Shubham opens his Gmail, he finds an **invitation letter** — “You’ve been assigned a new task in Online Shopping Project.” Once he clicks the link, he enters the very same office from his own door. He doesn’t need to depend on Ashish’s screen anymore. His dashboard will show:

* The project name: **Online Shopping**
* The task list: “UML diagram” (Assigned to him)
* Status column: To Do → In Progress → Done

This is exactly how big companies use JIRA:

* Managers **don’t run behind developers** asking, “Shubham, did you finish UML diagrams?”
* Developers **don’t chase managers** to tell, “Sir, I finished ER diagram.”
  The board itself becomes a **single source of truth**. Everyone sees the same status live.

And notice, Rohit, even though we are students and we don’t pay for it, with just a free trial we are **experiencing professional teamwork practices**. When you go for interviews and the HR asks, *“Do you know JIRA?”*, you won’t just say *“Yes, I have heard of it.”* Instead, you’ll confidently say:

> “I created a free JIRA workspace, invited my team, assigned tasks, tracked progress, and managed an Online Shopping project using bug tracking workflow.”

That answer itself shows you didn’t just study tools — you **lived the experience of collaboration**.

🌱 So, think of today’s session like planting a seed. You may not become a full-fledged project manager today, but at least you’ve walked inside the JIRA office once. Tomorrow, when you join a company, you’ll know exactly which door to knock.



👉 *“Team, just imagine this like we’re all sitting in the same project room. Earlier we used to keep a whiteboard – someone would write ‘To Do’, ‘In Progress’, ‘Done’, and stick paper chits. Whoever finishes a task moves their chit to ‘Done’. That was physical Scrum board.*

✨ Now, Jira is our **digital Scrum board**.
When Shubham got the task notification by email, he didn’t need to log into multiple systems. Jira and email are integrated. The moment he clicked ‘View Issue’, he wasn’t redirected to a random page – he was inside the secure Atlassian cloud (see the URL). That’s like opening your chit board, but this time on the internet.

Then, we noticed the **profile at the top-right**: SV → Shubham Verma. So, we know who is logged in. Shubham added a **comment**: “Which UML diagram to draw?” Immediately, the whole team could see it – even Samridha without refreshing. That’s collaboration in real-time, just like chatting in WhatsApp, but here it’s structured around tasks.

Now, look at the **workflow**:

* To Do
* In Progress
* In Review
* Done

When Shubham marked his task as ‘Done’, instantly Ashish also saw it as completed. That’s transparency – no need to call, no need to email – the board itself reflects reality.

Later, Ashish added a **Java code snippet** directly in Jira’s comment box. That means our tool isn’t just for status reporting; it also supports **contextual collaboration**. Tomorrow, if Akshay opens Jira, he can directly see the Java class Product with title and description variables – nicely highlighted in syntax colors – ready for him to build on.

💡 *So what’s happening here?*
We are not just tracking bugs. We are practicing **Agile values**: transparency, collaboration, communication, and iterative progress. Jira is acting as our **virtual project room** – like a digital extension of our team culture.

And the best part – none of this data lives on Shubham’s laptop or Ashish’s machine. It’s stored in Atlassian’s cloud data center in Australia. That’s why even if we are spread across Pune, Nagpur, Singapore, or New England, we still feel like we’re working together side by side.

Think of it this way –

* Facebook = connect with friends
* Instagram = share memories
* WhatsApp = chat in real-time
* Jira = collaborate as a **virtual software team**

So yes, Jira creates a **virtual team room** where developers, testers, DBAs, and managers can work together – no matter where they are.”



👉 *“Yes team, Jira software will actually help you to create your **virtual team**. Think of it like each project group gets its own digital office. Every virtual team has its own separate site – see the URL on top? For example, here it’s `EDAC ISCSD 2021 Atlassian.net`. That’s not just a web address; that’s like your team’s **workspace in the cloud**.*

Now imagine – in this virtual office, you don’t have just two developers. You might have:

* 3–4 developers,
* 2 testers,
* 1 project manager,
* 1 team lead,
* quality assurance members…

All of them working together on the same **portal**. This portal is what keeps everyone connected, even if they’re spread across Nagpur, Pune, or Singapore.

✨ Let’s see how it works:
When you click **Create Issue**, you can define a task or a bug. For example:

* Summary: *Database server not responding*
* Description: *Maybe database updates are not reflected. Using SQL Server 2014.*
* Priority: High (red arrow icon)
* Due Date: 27th of this month
* Attachment: Screenshot of the error

That’s like writing the problem on a chit, attaching the error photo, and pinning it to the team’s board. But here, it’s all digital, structured, and visible to everyone in real time.

Next, you assign this issue to someone – say Ashish. The moment it’s assigned, Ashish gets notified. He can add his comments, maybe even attach code snippets or screenshots. Shubham can see this update instantly, Akshay can raise a related bug, and Samridha can track the progress – all without picking up the phone.

💡 *Notice the beauty here*: Jira doesn’t store this data on your laptop or my laptop. It lives in **Atlassian’s cloud data centers**. That’s why, whether you’re sitting in Mansar farmhouse or in Silicon Valley, the experience is the same.

And this is exactly why today’s world is shifting. You don’t have to physically go to an office. You can be in Bandarpur, still work for a Silicon Valley project, get paid in dollars, and manage everything through Jira. That’s why so many people are becoming **freelancers** – they pick a project, work for 6–7 months remotely, finish it, and then take up another.

Think about it –

* **Jira** = Project management and collaboration
* **GitHub/GitLab** = Source code management
* **Eclipse/VS Code/Visual Studio** = Coding environments
* **Slack/Teams** = Daily team communication

Together, these tools form your **virtual software company**. You don’t own the building, but you own the skill. And with skill + collaboration tools, you can work for any client, anywhere in the world.

So remember – Jira is **not for coding**. You don’t write your Java or C# programs inside Jira. Instead, Jira is like your **digital project diary + whiteboard + task tracker**. It keeps your whole team aligned, accountable, and transparent.

And the day you all master this culture, you’ll be ready not only for jobs in IT companies, but also for freelancing and international projects.”

👉 *“Friends, today I want you to see a big picture. In software engineering, your life is never limited to just coding. Coding is one part of the game. But to actually deliver a working product, you need to master and connect multiple tools together.”*

* For **collaboration**, you’ll use **Microsoft Teams** – that’s your virtual conference room.
* For **coding**, you’ll use **Eclipse** – that’s your desk where you write logic.
* For **source code management**, you’ll use **GitHub** – that’s your filing cabinet, storing every version of your program.
* For **testing**, you’ll use **Selenium drivers** or **Jasmine tools** – these are like your quality inspectors.
* For **analysis**, you’ll use **ODML diagrams** – your project blueprints.
* For **debugging**, you’ll use your **debugger tools** – like your detective lens.
* For **packaging**, you’ll use installer tools like **InstallShield** – which is like neatly wrapping your software before delivery.

✨ *So remember, my friends, being a developer today is not just “knowing Java or C# syntax.” You must know **coding + development + linking + integration**. Only then you are industry-ready.*


🔹 **Now let’s connect this to Jira.**
Jira is your **project management and task-tracking hub**.

“Let’s try something. Ashish, look at the top-right corner. Do you see the option ‘Create Project’? Click that. Yes, not ‘Create Task’, but ‘Create Project’. Good. Now when you choose ‘View all projects’, what do you see?”

* “We only have one project: **Online Shopping Application Project**.”
* “Who is the lead here? Correct, *Ashish Shende*.”

👉 Now imagine Ashish wants to start a fresh project. Can he do it? Yes, he just clicks **Create Project** again.

This time, let’s pick a **Scrum template** instead of Bug Fixing. Why? Because Scrum is a framework of Agile methodology. It gives us **To Do → In Progress → Done** boards, Sprint planning, and backlog management.

So Ashish, go ahead – name this project **Examination Online**. Jira will create a brand-new space with its own tasks, sprints, and roadmap.

🔹 **Let’s add tasks now.**

* Task 1: *Create public code repository on GitHub.* Assign it to Akshay.
* Task 2: *Install Java Runtime.* Assign it to Akshay again, maybe attach a deadline.

Once you create these, you’ll notice they appear in **To Do** or **Backlog** depending on how Scrum organizes it. From there, during Sprint planning, the **Product Owner** decides which tasks get higher priority and move into the active Sprint.

🔹 **See the Roadmap now.**
On the left, click **Roadmap**. That’s your **Gantt chart view**. It shows the project timeline – which activity starts, what’s next, how long each will run. If your project is 4 months, Jira will draw a 4-month plan.

So instead of everyone running around confused, the team has a single shared calendar.

👉 *And this is the magic, friends. If during your final-year project, you create a free Jira account, define your project tasks, assign them to your teammates, link your GitHub repository, and capture screenshots – imagine the impression you’ll make in an interview. The interviewer won’t just see code, he’ll see your **process maturity**. He’ll see that you know how the industry really works.*

📌 And before I forget – from exam perspective, remember one MCQ:
**Templates in Jira** → Kanban, Scrum, Bug Tracking.


💡 *So always remember, don’t learn just for exams. Learn for understanding. Because knowledge of tools + practice of process = industry-ready engineer.*

👉 *“Friends, you have a lot of options inside Jira. Take your time. Don’t rush. Explore those features. Try ready-made templates – Scrum, Kanban, Bug tracking – because unless you **initiate a project**, you’ll never really understand or enjoy software engineering concepts. Otherwise, SE will remain just theory from your textbook.”*

Now, notice how I keep giving examples from our **Online Examination Project**. Why? Because you can **correlate**. Tomorrow, you may think – “Yes, I want to work on my online project. Let me try Jira for project tracking. Let me keep my code in GitHub. Let me use VS Code for editing. Let me build frontend in React, backend in Node.js, APIs in Spring Boot.”

✨ If you bring all of these together into **one integrated project**, that’s your **breakthrough point for employability**.

🔹 **But remember one thing**:
Knowing a tool is not enough. You need to know **why** you’re using it.

👉 Suppose you have a hammer. But you don’t know where to hit. That hammer is useless. Same hammer in Thor’s hands becomes **Mjolnir** – a powerful weapon. The difference is not the hammer, the difference is **how you use it**.

Software tools are like that. Jira, GitHub, VS Code, Selenium – they are just weapons. What matters is your **scenario understanding**. In what context do you apply which tool?

That’s why in Jira we talk about:

* **Epics** → Large stories (scenarios)
* **Stories/Tasks** → Smaller cases derived from the epic
* **Bugs** → Issues to fix

So, case studies and scenarios are the key.

🔹 **Content Management in Jira**
Some students ask: “Sir, is Jira like Google Drive or GitHub repository where we store code and files?”
No. Jira’s **content** is not images, not Java/Python code, not PDFs. Its content is:

* Tasks
* Bugs
* Epics
* Stories

It’s a **content management system for work tracking**, not file storage.


🔹 **Integration with GitHub**
But don’t worry – Jira doesn’t live alone. It integrates beautifully with **GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket**.

* You write your code in Eclipse or VS Code.
* You push it to GitHub using `git commit`.
* That GitHub commit can be linked directly to a Jira issue key.
* Now, when someone opens Jira, they don’t just see “Task Done”, they also see **which commit fixed it**.

So Jira + GitHub = Complete **work tracking + code traceability**.


🔹 **Cloud Elasticity**
Deepali asked – *“Sir, how many projects can I create in Jira?”*
Good question. Jira is a **cloud tool**, and cloud = **elastic**.

So in theory, you can create **10,000 projects**. But practically, your plan (Free, Standard, Premium) decides how many projects, how much storage, how much bandwidth.

* Free plan: Maybe 10–20 projects (enough for practice).
* Paid plan: Unlimited.

Think of it like your mobile data pack – same internet, but speed and volume depend on your plan.


👉 And remember – you don’t need to buy servers, you don’t need your own company office. With just Jira + GitHub + VS Code + free cloud services, **10 people can run a project for 6 months** like a startup. That’s the **power of cloud-based development culture**.



📌 *So, let’s do this – after our short break, we’ll shift gears. We’ll practice GitHub hands-on: create repositories, push our online shopping code, make commits, and link it with Jira. That’s how your assignments should also go – instead of sending me files on WhatsApp, just share your GitHub repo URL. That’s industry practice, that’s employability.”*


👨‍🏫 *“Friends, before you rush into creating repositories, remember: the first foundation of GitHub is your **verified identity**. Unless you verify both primary and secondary emails, GitHub won’t trust you fully. That’s like entering a college without your admission card – you’re inside, but not official yet.”*

So I ask Deepak – *“Can you click the option verify email?”*
He goes to Gmail, finds the latest mail, clicks **Verify Email Address**.
✅ Done. GitHub now says: *Email Verified*.

Now the next milestone: **Repositories.**

🗂 *“Repositories are like your cupboards. Each cupboard holds one category of work. Inside your Sedac course, you’re going to learn many subjects. Why dump everything in one cupboard? Instead, create one repo per subject. For example – DBT repo for SQL files, Java repo for Java programs.”*

We ask Hardik to share his screen. He creates a new repository → **DBT** → selects **Public** → adds README → clicks Create.
Now his account shows **2 repositories.**


👨‍🏫 *“Great. Now let’s create another repo – this time for Java. But this time, make it **Private**. Why? Because in industry, not every project is for public viewing. Some are company secrets. Some are client-specific. Public repo = everyone can see. Private repo = only invited members can access.”*

Hardik creates a **Java (Private)** repo.
Then, he uploads Java files by dragging and dropping them.
Finally, he writes a commit message: *“My first Java programs – basics of OOP and projects.”*
✅ Now files are visible inside GitHub.


At this point, Dipanshu asks: *“Sir, why are we writing commit messages?”*
Good question.

👨‍🏫 *“Every commit is like writing a diary entry. Tomorrow when you or your teammate comes back, they should know *why* you uploaded or changed something. Without commit messages, your repo is like a storybook with no chapter titles.”*


Then comes the important realization:
When Hardik shares the **Java repo URL**, others see **Page Not Found**.

👨‍🏫 *“Why? Because it’s Private. Only people whose email IDs Hardik adds as collaborators can enter. Just like a WhatsApp group – unless admin adds you, you can’t see the messages.”*

Hardik goes to **Settings → Manage Access → Invite Collaborator**, adds Tushar, Akshay, Sankalp.
They get email invites. Sankalp accepts → boom 💥 now he can see Java repo.



Now Sankalp wants to **download files locally.**

👨‍🏫 *“Remember, GitHub is a cloud cupboard. But to work, you need a local copy of the cupboard at home. That’s where **git clone** comes in. But first, do we have Git client installed?”*

Sankalp types:

```bash
git -v
```

Output: *git not recognized*.

👨‍🏫 *“This means Git client is missing. Without it, your computer doesn’t understand GitHub’s language. Let’s download Git for Windows (47MB), install with default settings.”*

After install, command works:

```bash
git --version
```

Now Git is ready.

---

Next step: cloning the repo.
We create a folder **EDAC** → open Command Prompt there → increase font size for visibility → type:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```

👨‍🏫 *“This command is like saying: bring me a full cupboard from the cloud and put it in my room. Now you can open, edit, or add files. Later, when you’re ready, you’ll push changes back to the cloud cupboard.”*


🔑 **Mentor’s Closing Note:**
*“What did we learn? GitHub is not just a place to dump code. It’s a system of trust (email verification), organization (repos), teamwork (public/private, collaborators), documentation (commit messages), and synchronization (clone, pull, push). These are the same habits used in companies – the same skills that make you employable.”*

Excellent Ravi 👏
This part of your narration is like the **next logical milestone in the GitHub journey** — from just *cloning a repo* to *modifying files, staging them, committing them, and preparing to push back*.


👨‍🏫 *“So friends, yesterday we saw how Sankalp cloned Hardik’s repository into his local EDAC folder. The cupboard from the cloud came home. Today we’ll see: can Sankalp put something back into that cupboard?”*

👉 First reality check: Because Hardik’s repo is **private**, cloning asked Sankalp for his GitHub **username and password**.
🗝️ *“This is like the guard at the society gate — if your name is on the invitation list, only then you can enter.”*

So Sankalp typed his GitHub ID and password → and yes, files downloaded into `EDAC/Java`.


Now comes the developer’s role.
Sankalp opens one file in **Notepad** (since Eclipse was tricky).
He adds a small comment at the top.
Saves the file.

👨‍🏫 *“Simple but powerful. A developer downloaded code, made a change, saved it. But right now, this change is only inside Sankalp’s laptop. GitHub cloud doesn’t know anything.”*


Next step: checking what Git thinks.

```bash
git status
```

Output: *One file modified.*

👨‍🏫 *“See? Git is like a CCTV camera watching your project folder. The moment you touch a file, it says — hey, one file is modified! But unless you register it, Git won’t take it seriously.”*

So we run:

```bash
git add progm-1.java
```

👨‍🏫 *“`git add` is like saying: Dear Git, please take this modified file and keep it in your basket for the next upload.”*

Now the file is staged.

---

Next command:

```bash
git commit -m "My first commit – added a comment"
```

💡 Here Git complained: *“Unable to detect your email address.”*
Why? Because Git wants to know **who is writing in the diary.**

So we configure:

```bash
git config --global user.email "sankalp@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Sankalp"
```

Now commit works fine.
✅ The change is logged locally.

👨‍🏫 *“But remember — commit is local. You wrote a diary entry at home. If you want your team to see it, you need to publish it to GitHub cloud. That’s where `git push` comes in.”*

Command:

```bash
git push origin main
```

If authentication is correct → GitHub updates.
Then Hardik, Tushar, Akshay — everyone will see the modified file in their repos.
