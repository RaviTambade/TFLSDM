### **How to Use This Scrum Board in Jira / Trello**

1. **Epics**: Create each Epic (e.g., User Authentication, Product Catalog).
2. **User Stories**: Add stories under each Epic.
3. **Tasks/Sub-tasks**: Break stories into development tasks.
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: Add to story description or checklist.
5. **Sprint Assignment**: Assign stories to Sprints based on priority.
6. **Tracking**: Use columns **To Do → In Progress → Done** to manage workflow.


## BDD Approach

# **Feature: Product Catalog**

**As a** customer,
**I want** to browse, search, and filter products,
**So that** I can easily find the items I want to purchase.

---

## **1. Business Goal / Value**

The **Product Catalog** is the heart of the E-Commerce application. Its main purpose is to provide a **user-friendly interface** for customers to explore products, understand their details, and make informed purchase decisions.

* **Business Value:** Higher product visibility → increased user engagement → higher sales conversion.

---

## **2. Stakeholders**

| **Role**       | **Responsibility / Interest**                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Customer       | Browse, search, filter, and view product details easily.                |
| Admin          | Ensure products and categories are updated accurately.                  |
| Business Owner | Increase sales by providing intuitive navigation and product discovery. |
| QA/Tester      | Validate catalog features for accuracy, usability, and performance.     |


## **3. Scope**

**In Scope:**

* Display product list by category and subcategory.
* Search products by name, description, or SKU.
* Filter products by price range, category, and availability.
* View detailed product information: images, description, stock, price.
* Paginate results if the list is long.

**Out of Scope (for initial version):**

* AI-based recommendations.
* Personalized sorting based on user behavior.
* Multi-language support (future enhancement).



## **4. Functional Requirements**

| **ID**   | **Requirement**    | **Description / Acceptance Criteria**                                            |
| -------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PC-FR-01 | Browse by Category | Users can select a category/subcategory to view related products.                |
| PC-FR-02 | Search             | Users can search products using keywords (name, SKU, description).               |
| PC-FR-03 | Filter             | Users can filter products by price range, availability, and category.            |
| PC-FR-04 | Product Details    | Clicking a product shows detailed info: name, description, price, stock, images. |
| PC-FR-05 | Pagination         | Product lists are paginated to improve performance for large catalogs.           |
| PC-FR-06 | Sort               | Users can sort by price (low to high, high to low), newest arrivals.             |


## **5. Non-Functional Requirements**

* Response time for product listing < 2 seconds.
* Must handle up to 10,000 products efficiently.
* UI must be responsive for desktop and mobile.
* Security: Ensure product information cannot be manipulated by end-users.



## **6. User Stories (for BDD / Gherkin)**

1. **Browse by Category**

   * **Given** the product catalog is available
   * **When** the customer selects a category
   * **Then** the catalog displays all products under that category

2. **Search Products**

   * **Given** the product catalog is available
   * **When** the customer enters a keyword in the search bar
   * **Then** the catalog displays all products matching the keyword

3. **Filter Products**

   * **Given** the product catalog is displayed
   * **When** the customer applies filters (price range, availability)
   * **Then** only products matching the filters are displayed

4. **View Product Details**

   * **Given** the product catalog is displayed
   * **When** the customer clicks on a product
   * **Then** the system shows detailed information including images, price, stock, and description

5. **Pagination**

   * **Given** there are more than 20 products in a category
   * **When** the catalog page loads
   * **Then** products are displayed in pages of 20 items each with navigation controls

6. **Sorting**

   * **Given** the product catalog is displayed
   * **When** the customer chooses a sort option (price or newest arrivals)
   * **Then** the products are displayed according to the selected sort criteria

---

## **7. Acceptance Criteria**

* Customers can browse, search, filter, and sort products seamlessly.
* Clicking a product opens a detail page with complete product information.
* Large product lists are efficiently paginated.
* UI is responsive and performs well under load.



```gherkin
Feature: Product Catalog
  As a customer
  I want to browse, search, filter, and sort products
  So that I can easily find the items I want to purchase

    When the customer enters "Headphones" in the search bar
    Then the catalog displays all products matching "Headphones"

  @Filter

    When the customer applies filters:
      | FilterType | Value         |
      | Price      | 1000-5000     |
      | Availability | In Stock     |
    Then only products matching the filters are displayed

      | Name          | Wireless Headphones |
      | Price         | 2999            |

      | Images        | 3 images displayed |

  @Pagination
  Scenario: Paginate product list
    Given there are more than 20 products in the "Electronics" category
    When the catalog page loads
    Then products are displayed in pages of 20 items each with navigation controls

  @Sort
  Scenario: Sort products by price
    Given the customer is viewing products in the "Electronics" category

```



### **Notes**

1. Each `Scenario` corresponds to a **BDD user story / acceptance criteria**.
2. `Background` defines **preconditions** shared by all scenarios (the catalog is available).
3. `@Tags` like `@BrowseCategory`, `@Search` help you **run specific scenarios** in Cucumber.
4. Tables are used for **filter values and product attributes** for clarity and data-driven testing.
