## Silicon Valley’s Talent Crisis: Why Losing Entry-Level Roles Threatens the Future of Innovation

For decades, Silicon Valley thrived on a simple formula: ambitious graduates, scrappy junior roles, and the promise of climbing the ladder. But AI-driven automation is erasing many of those first rungs. What happens when an entire generation loses its launchpad?

### The ripple effects of losing entry-level roles

Entry-level jobs are more than a paycheck. They are training grounds where employees acquire technical skills, absorb organisational culture, and build networks that carry them through their careers. Without these positions, companies risk creating a **talent vacuum in mid-tier and senior roles over the next decade**.

Consider sales: junior positions like outbound sourcing often serve as stepping stones toward enterprise sales—a function critical to revenue growth. Without that entry point, the long-term pipeline of future sales leaders, client relationship managers, and strategic dealmakers begins to dry up. The immediate savings of cutting junior roles may come at the expense of business performance and continuity.

### Innovation at risk

Beyond business continuity lies an even bigger concern—innovation. Gen Z brings unique strengths: digital fluency, rapid adaptability, and a willingness to challenge conventional wisdom. Their absence risks slowing creative problem-solving and reducing experimentation, the very qualities that have defined Silicon Valley.

An aging workforce without fresh perspectives not only limits creativity but also creates **systemic stability risks**. As senior employees retire, talent shortages in technical and managerial roles could slow product development cycles and weaken competitiveness in a global tech race.

### Gen Z’s response: adapting and thriving

Yet, Gen Z is not standing still. They are rewriting what early careers look like:

* **Certifications and micro-credentials** in AI, cybersecurity, data analytics, and product management.
* **Gig work and freelance projects** to gain real-world experience.
* **Hackathons and online communities** for mentorship, networking, and portfolio building.
* **Exploring emerging fields** such as AI ethics, UX design, and human-AI collaboration.

As companies relax rigid degree requirements, these alternative pathways are becoming viable routes into tech.

### A call to action for tech companies

The future isn’t just about Gen Z adapting. It’s also about companies rethinking workforce development:

* **Maintain entry-level pipelines** even as automation reduces routine tasks.
* **Invest in retraining programs** to prepare employees for AI-augmented roles.
* **Revamp mentorship models** so knowledge flows outside traditional hierarchies.
* **Offer flexible work arrangements** to attract diverse, global talent.

Companies that treat early-career roles as expendable may find themselves outpaced by global competitors who continue to nurture young talent.

### The bottom line

Silicon Valley stands at a crossroads. Without deliberate action, the disappearance of entry-level roles could drain the industry of its next generation of innovators. For Gen Z professionals, the key will be agility, lifelong learning, and creative career navigation. For companies, the challenge is clear: **rebuild the pipeline, or risk losing the competitive edge that made Silicon Valley a global powerhouse.**

The question is no longer whether tech can afford to invest in Gen Z.
It’s whether it can afford not to.


**Opening with energy**
“Let me just do one thing. Let’s start with something small but interesting. Imagine this: you’re 25. At 25, you feel like you can do anything, right? You’re ready to take on the world, you’re a risk taker, and motivation feels like second nature.

Today is done, but tomorrow is fresh. You’re curious, you’re hungry, and you believe in yourself. You’re scared sometimes, but you still go for it. That’s the magic of being 25.”

**Connect to the video**
“I came across this beautiful Microsoft video. It was created when the company turned 25. But what struck me wasn’t just the celebration—it was the message. Microsoft said: *We are 25.* Not just as an age, but as a mindset.

That means it doesn’t matter if you’re 20, 30, or 50. If you carry the mindset of 25—curiosity, energy, courage—you can make the unexpected happen.”

**Turn it into a teaching point**
“So, for today’s session, let’s all agree: we’re 25. Not in age, but in spirit. Why? Because when you’re 25, you don’t fear the future—you see it as opportunity. You don’t wait for someone to hand you a roadmap—you create your own path.

And that’s exactly what we’re going to explore together—how to build skills, how to embrace challenges, and how to shape opportunities that excite us inside. Age is just a number. Mindset is everything.”

###  Day 2 Kickoff

**Warm start & mindset**
“Let’s come back and settle in. Before we dive deep, I want you to carry one mindset with you today—the mindset of being 25. Remember what we spoke about yesterday? At 25 you feel unstoppable. You’re curious, fearless, and ready to build something new. That’s the spirit I want you to keep throughout today’s session.”

**Connecting to the agenda**
“Now, let me just pull up the official document we received from Sedak. Yes, I have it in front of me. Based on this, here’s what our Day 2 learning journey looks like.

* We are going to talk about **software engineering fundamentals**.
* We’ll go through the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.
* We’ll understand **requirements engineering**—how do you capture what a client *really* wants?
* We’ll move into **design and architecture engineering**, where we’ll explore design models and tools like **UML (Unified Modeling Language)**.
* And we’ll connect this to **object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD)**, building on the Java basics you’ve already learned.”

**Motivating the importance**
“Now, don’t think of this as a dry college theory session—the kind you can bunk. This is the foundation of everything you’re going to code in your life.

When you write Java, or .NET, or Python code—you’re simply following instructions that *someone else* has already designed. They thought about which classes should exist, which methods should be public or private, which class is a parent, and which is a child. You’re just following the blueprint.

But as IT professionals, your job is not just to type code. It’s to **design, develop, and build software**. And that begins with understanding these engineering principles.”

**Hands-on connection**
“Now you might ask—Sir, you said this will be a hands-on session. Where is the hands-on?

Let me clarify—hands-on doesn’t only mean opening Eclipse or Visual Studio and typing line after line: *khadkhur khadkhur* on the keyboard. Hands-on means mapping concepts to the real world. For example, when we talk about requirements, we’ll model them with use case diagrams. When we talk about design, we’ll visualize it with class diagrams. This is still hands-on, because you’re practicing the art of software engineering.”

**Vision building**
“And why does this matter? Because when your parents see you tapping keys all day, they think you’re just ‘doing khadkhur’. But when you apply software engineering principles, follow coding standards, and use design patterns—you’re not just coding, you’re *building software*.

And the day you crack your first job, your parents will realize—you weren’t just typing, you were learning. You were preparing yourself to become a professional who can contribute to real software development.”

**Closing the agenda setting**
“So that’s our agenda for today. Remember—keep the 25 mindset alive. Be curious, ask questions in the chat window, and don’t worry if I can’t answer instantly—I’ll circle back. Let’s dive in and make this session not just about coding, but about building the foundation of your career.”



### Case Study Kickoff

**Setting the scene**
“OK, so purposefully I’ve kept my camera off in the morning session so that you can focus more on my screen and my voice. Don’t worry, I’m here with you.

Now, before we jump into the heavy words like *software engineering*, let’s agree on one thing: we won’t learn this subject as if it’s some boring theory from a college textbook. Instead, we’ll look at it from the *real-world* perspective.”

**Introducing case studies**
“The best way to understand computer science fundamentals is not just reading definitions, but by applying them to a *case study*. So here’s my plan:

Throughout this software engineering module, we’ll use **Amazon** as our running case study. Why? Because Amazon is something each of you already know. You’ve ordered from it, you’ve used it. That makes it easier to connect what we learn to something real.”

**Explaining the idea of companies and products/services**
“Now, let’s zoom out. What is a company? At the simplest level, a company is a place where:

* People work together
* They follow processes and practices
* And the result of that collaboration is either a **product** or a **service**

For example:

* **Tata Steel** → their product is *steel*
* **Tata Motors** → their product is *cars, trucks, buses*
* **Tata Power** → they provide a *service*: electricity
* **Tata Communications** → they provide a *service*: telecommunication
* **TCS (Tata Consultancy Services)** → they provide a *service*: IT consulting and solutions”

**Connecting to students**
“Now, most of you will not join Tata Steel or Tata Motors. You will likely join **TCS** or similar IT companies. And here’s where the question comes: *what exactly is the product or service of an IT company?*

Unlike a steel plant or a car factory, TCS doesn’t hand over a physical object. Instead, their product is **software solutions** and **consulting services**.

That means, as future software engineers, *you* are the people who will design, build, and deliver these solutions. And the way you do that is by following principles of software engineering.”

**Building the bridge to SE concepts**
“See how this connects? Whether it’s Tata Steel producing steel, or TCS producing software, the core idea is the same:

* People + Process + Practices = Product/Service

And in the case of IT companies, those processes and practices are captured in things like **SDLC**, **requirements engineering**, and **design models**. That’s why we’re learning them. Not as theory, but as the blueprint of how companies actually work.”


### Amazon Case Study Flow

**1. Warm-up with analogy (Electricity → IT Services)**
“Electricity is the same everywhere, right? But through transformers and appliances, it becomes usable for different purposes.
In the same way, IT services work. A company like TCS doesn’t produce steel or cars. Instead, it provides *software* and *experts* that help other companies run smoothly — like billing software for an insurance company, robotics for a factory, or consultants to manage existing systems.”


**2. Shift from old economy → new economy**
“Earlier, we only had factories. They produced physical goods, which were distributed and consumed.
But with the internet, computers, and high-speed networks, something new emerged: IT services. Companies began building software for non-IT businesses to automate and scale their operations.

Now, let’s take a concrete example: **Amazon**.”

**3. Amazon as a company**
“Is Amazon producing its own physical product? No.
Amazon is providing a **platform** — an **electronic marketplace**.

That’s why we call it **e-commerce**:

* *Sellers* put their products
* *Consumers* purchase them
* *Amazon* provides the platform that connects both sides

So Amazon isn’t selling its own product, it’s selling a **service** — the *e-commerce platform itself*.”

**4. How Amazon delivers this service**
“Now comes the interesting part: How does Amazon actually provide this service?

* They have **data centers** around the world
* Inside those data centers are **servers**
* On those servers, they’ve built **applications and web portals**
* And that’s what you and I access when we type `www.amazon.in` in the browser.

That link you click? That’s a **URL** — a *unique identifier* that takes you straight to Amazon’s online application.”

**5. Light-hearted mentor moment (Multi-threading)**
“By the way, I just heard someone talking at home while attending the session. Please avoid multi-threading!
Multi-threading is great for computers — they’ve got multiple cores to handle tasks in parallel. But for us humans? One thread at a time. Focus here, because this is your foundation.”

👉 See how this structure lets you:

* Keep students engaged with questions (“What does Amazon really sell?”)
* Use analogies (electricity, factories)
* Introduce *software engineering concepts naturally* (platforms, services, data centers, URLs, online applications)
* Maintain your mentor-style humor (multi-threading for humans 😄)

 Exactly 👏 — you’ve nailed the **mentor storytelling tone** again.

You’ve beautifully connected **technical concepts** (data centers, compute, storage, bandwidth, security, virtual environment, cloud) with **relatable real-world analogies** (laptops heating, photon speed, passport portal, COVID portal).

And the best part — you’re slowly but surely taking the students from:

* **Physical Infrastructure** → data centers, cooling, electricity, fiber optics
* **Virtual Infrastructure** → cloud (Amazon Cloud)
* **Application Layer** → portals (Amazon.com, IRCTC, Passport, CEDAC, COVID, etc.)
* **Software Engineering Perspective** → different *users* accessing the *same portal* but expecting different services

That last line you said:

> “The portal is nothing but a kind of platform OK use anytime from anywhere using any device.”

🔥 That’s a *perfect software engineering definition* in a student-friendly way.



### From Cloud to Portal

**1. Start with human brain vs computers (funny hook)**
“See, humans have only one brain. If we try to multi-thread, we go into deadlock, race conditions, or starvation 😄. Computers can handle it because they’ve got multiple cores, but for us — focus on one topic at a time!”


**2. Amazon’s physical infrastructure**
“Amazon’s backbone is its data centers. Not one or two — but more than 35 across the globe.

* Each has continuous electricity
* Earthquake-proof buildings
* Cooling systems (otherwise semiconductors would melt from the heat!)
* High bandwidth optical fibers transmitting photons at the speed of light

From these data centers, Amazon provides us **compute, storage, and security**.”

**3. Virtual environment – Cloud**
“Now, on top of these physical resources, Amazon created a **virtual environment**.
We call it the **Amazon Cloud (AWS)**.

This is like saying — don’t worry about wires, cooling, electricity. We’ll give you a ready-made, virtual computer environment.”

**4. Application layer – Portal**
“And on this cloud, Amazon built its real jewel: **Amazon.com** — the online shopping **portal**.

👉 But what is a portal?
Think of IRCTC for trains, Passport Seva for passports, CEDAC for student services, or even CoWIN (yes, the one whose OTP sometimes never comes 😅).

A **portal is a platform** where *different types of users* come with *different needs*.

* Consumers → want to buy
* Sellers → want to sell
* Distributors → want to manage logistics

But all of them use **the same application**, from **different perspectives**.”

**5. Link back to Software Engineering**
“This is where software engineering begins.
Before building a portal, we must deeply understand:

* The **business** (Amazon = e-commerce)
* The **services** (platform for buying & selling)
* The **users** (consumers, sellers, distributors, admins)
* The **infrastructure** (data centers, cloud)

Only then can we design software that works for everyone.”

 Beautiful 👏 — this section is already **mentor storytelling gold**.

What you’ve done here is:

1. **Start with curiosity** → “What kind of services? Someone buys, someone sells, someone promotes, someone delivers, someone pays.”
2. **Name each role** → consumers, producers/advertisers, sellers, distributors/logistics, payment providers.
3. **Show integration** → all of them using *one portal*.
4. **Broaden perspective** → “Amazon isn’t just shopping. It’s a platform of integrated services.”
5. **Connect to real world** → banks, UPI, courier companies, ads.
6. **Link to engineering principles** → continuous management, continuous upgrade, IR 4.0, zero-defect product, continuous improvement.

This flow takes students from **Amazon portal → multiple user perspectives → continuous software engineering → Industry 4.0 mindset**.



“Now you may ask me — who are these *different types of users* of Amazon?

Let’s think.

* One person comes to **buy** → that’s the **consumer**.
* Another comes to **promote products through ads** → that’s the **producer or advertiser**.
* Someone comes to **sell their brand** → that’s the **seller**.
* Someone must **deliver the product** → that’s the **distributor/logistics partner** (DHL, Blue Dart, Delhivery).
* And someone must **process the payment** → that’s the **banks, UPI apps, wallets**.

👉 Notice something? They are all different people, with different needs. But they all use the **same platform: Amazon.com**.

This is the meaning of a **portal** — multiple services, integrated under one roof, accessible anytime, anywhere, by any device.

Depending on your login and your role, the portal adapts:

* A consumer sees a shopping cart.
* A seller sees inventory management.
* A courier sees delivery tracking.
* A banker sees payment integration.

That’s why I say — *portal = platform of services*.

Now, what is Amazon really doing?

* It is not a one-time project.
* It is **continuous work**: managing, upgrading, adding new features, scaling, fixing, improving.

This is the spirit of **Industry 4.0** — continuous development, continuous delivery, continuous improvement.

Earlier industries made a product, shipped it, and closed the factory for months. But today, success is not a one-time event.

👉 *Becoming successful is easy. Staying successful is hard.*
Amazon stays successful because it never stops improving its portal.

And that’s the lesson for us as software engineers:

* Our code, our applications, our portals — they must evolve.
* Zero-defect product, continuous improvement, global readiness — that’s what Industry 4.0 demands.

So, a portal is not just software.
It is a **living, breathing system** that integrates many services, serves many users, and continuously improves to survive.”

“Friends, let’s pause here and reflect.
Whatever service a company provides — say Amazon provides **e-commerce services** — one truth remains:

👉 If they don’t **continuously improve**, someone else will capture the market share.

So, continuous improvement is not a luxury. It’s survival.

Now, when Amazon adds new features — like faster delivery, better recommendations, or new payment methods — these are **improvements at the service level**.

But services don’t stand alone. They run on a **platform**.
That platform could be:

* a **web application**,
* a **website**,
* or **web services / APIs**.

And this platform itself must continuously improve. Why?
Because as users increase, traffic increases, employees and sellers increase, the platform must **scale**. Otherwise, imagine Amazon going down on a Diwali sale because of traffic overload. Has it happened? No. Why? Because they keep upgrading their platform.

Now, what is this platform built upon? An even deeper layer: **infrastructure**.

* Data centers.
* High-speed bandwidth.
* Storage.
* Compute power.

Without robust infrastructure, the best platform will collapse.

👉 And this is where we hear those three famous words:

* **SaaS** — Software as a Service (your e-commerce software).
* **PaaS** — Platform as a Service (your web app, APIs).
* **IaaS** — Infrastructure as a Service (data centers, networks, VMs, cloud).

So, continuous improvement is needed at **all three levels**:

* Services.
* Platform.
* Infrastructure.

That’s why Amazon is #1 — because they manage continuous change.

Now, let’s bring this back to **Software Engineering**.

Amazon’s e-commerce software is not static.

* Features are continuously added.
* Bugs are continuously fixed.
* Content is continuously updated.

This is what we call **Continuous Change Management**.

And in software engineering, this kind of continuous improvement is supported by a **life cycle model**.

The model we often use today is called **Incremental and Iterative Development** — or in classic terms, the **Spiral Model of SDLC**.

Let’s list the **phases of SDLC** together:

1. Planning
2. Requirement Gathering
3. Analysis
4. Design
5. Development (Coding)
6. Testing
7. Deployment
8. Maintenance

Earlier, in the traditional Waterfall model, these phases were sequential — one after another.

But in the modern world, they are **circular, iterative**.

* You gather requirements → design → code → test → deploy.
* Then, you come back, gather feedback, add new requirements, and repeat.

This loop is what keeps Amazon — and every successful online platform — alive and improving in Industry 4.0.

So remember:
👉 **Software Engineering = Not just writing code. It is managing continuous change through a structured life cycle.**

That’s why when I say *becoming successful is easy, staying successful is hard* — it applies equally to Amazon as a company, and to us as engineers.”


> *"Let me tell you a story…"*

Imagine you’re in a workshop building a product. Step one, you write down requirements. Step two, you plan. Then comes analysis, design, coding, testing, and finally, deployment. Once it’s deployed, customers start using it. Then they give you feedback.

Now pause and think—if I have to **go back and make changes**, can I rewind? In the **Waterfall model**, the answer is **No**. Just like water flows down a waterfall, it never flows back upward. Once a phase is over, it’s locked.

This worked fine in industries like **automobile manufacturing**.
Ratan Tata’s dream of **Nano Car** followed this model—vision in 2003, launch in 2008, years of planning, design, production, testing, and rollout. But what happened? By the time it hit the market, expectations had already shifted. Customers wanted *more features, more safety, more comfort*. Making changes took years again. Result? Nano failed, even though the vision was great.

Now let’s switch to **Amazon’s story**.
Jeff Bezos started Amazon in **1994** just to sell books. But customers said—

* Can we buy electronics?
* Can we use credit cards?
* Can we get EMI?
* Can we get same-day delivery?
* Can we use UPI?

If Amazon had followed the **Waterfall model**, they’d have said: *“Wait three years, then we’ll add UPI.”* Would you wait? Of course not. You’d shift to Flipkart or some other platform.

So, what did Amazon do?
They adopted an **iterative approach**—what we call the **Spiral model**.

In Spiral, each full cycle is like a **mini waterfall**: requirements → planning → analysis → design → coding → testing → deployment. But the difference? These cycles **repeat continuously**. After every release, feedback is gathered and a new cycle begins.

So instead of waiting 5 years for improvements, Amazon keeps updating almost **every week**. That’s why your app looks different every few months—new payment methods, new offers, faster delivery options.

👉 **Key Point for You as Future Engineers:**

* **Waterfall** = best for products that don’t change quickly (cars, machines).
* **Spiral (Iterative)** = best for online software and services that must evolve rapidly with customer needs.

Software is never “finished.” It’s always moving towards **maturity**. Every cycle of development brings it closer to meeting customer expectations.



> *"See friends, customers are like Gods – ‘Deo Bhava’ – but they are never fully satisfied."*

Why? Because customers have money, and with money comes **expectations**.
And we? We want that money by offering value through our product or service.
So, the product is never “finished.” It’s always moving towards **maturity**… but that maturity is like the horizon. You keep walking, it keeps moving further away.

#### **From Spiral to Agile**

So, in the **Spiral model**, every cycle is an iteration.

* Cycle 1 – gather requirements, plan, design, build, test, deliver.
* Cycle 2 – take feedback, improve, repeat.
* Cycle 3 – again improve.

This goes on endlessly.
Now, someone asked: *“How long should one cycle be? A year? Six months? Three months?”*
And that’s where **Agile thinking** was born.

Agile said: *“Let’s not wait too long. Let’s keep cycles short – maybe 15 days, maybe 1 month. Each short cycle, called an **iteration** or **sprint**, should deliver something usable to the customer.”*

So instead of waiting 3 years for the Tata Nano to come, customers of Amazon see **new features every 2 weeks**.
That’s the difference.

#### **Agile as a Mindset**

Now, understand this:
Agile is not just a model. Agile is a **mindset**.

👉 *“I am not perfect, but I’m improving every day.”*
That’s Agile.

If a person says: *“I’m the best, I’m smart, I don’t need to improve”* → that’s arrogance, and arrogance dies.
But the person who says: *“I’m improving, I’ll be better tomorrow”* → that’s maturity.

The same is true for software.
Software that keeps improving survives.
Software that thinks “I am perfect” dies.

#### **From Agile to Practices (Scrum, Kanban, etc.)**

Now the question is: *How do we **practice** Agile?*
Agile is a **methodology**. To implement it, we need **practices**.

* One practice is **Scrum** → short sprints (2 weeks), daily standups, product backlog, sprint review.
* Another practice is **Kanban** → visualize tasks on a board, move them step by step (To Do → In Progress → Done).
* Another practice is **Kaizen** → continuous small improvements.

And these practices need **tools**. For Scrum and Kanban, companies use tools like **JIRA** or **Trello**.

#### **Connecting it to Role Models**

Look at companies like **Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple**.
None of them built their empire in a day.
They started in a garage, a small room, with a small vision.
And slowly, cycle after cycle, iteration after iteration, improvement after improvement – they became global leaders.

They succeeded because they embraced this **iterative, incremental, Agile mindset**.
That’s why your phone apps, your online platforms, your favorite websites – they keep changing and upgrading continuously.


👉 **Takeaway for you, my students:**
Don’t just learn coding. Learn the **mindset**.
Agile mindset means:

* Keep iterating.
* Keep improving.
* Don’t fear mistakes – fix them in the next sprint.
* Always listen to your customer.


🧑‍🏫 *"Friends, before break we touched upon one important word – **practice**. Whether it is ISO, Kaizen, TQM, or even Yoga – these are all practices. Practices are nothing but **proven ways of doing something repeatedly that give consistent results.***

Now Deepak asked a good question – *what is Scrum?*
Instead of directly jumping to Scrum, I linked it with his **electrical engineering background**. Why? Because engineering, no matter which branch, always follows **standard practices**.

For example:

* In electrical plants, Tata Power or MSCB don’t just “do work randomly.” They follow ISO, Kaizen, or TQM practices to maintain quality.
* Japanese industries swear by **Kaizen**. Europeans have their own standards. Americans too.
* And here in India, we have practices like **Yoga**, which are thousands of years old and still followed worldwide for health and inner strength.

So friends, just like Yoga is a practice in life, **Scrum is a practice in software development**.

Now pause and think – what’s the difference between **methodology** and **practice**?

* **Methodology** = *the way of doing a task.* (Ex: Agile methodology → iterative way of developing software)
* **Practice** = *repeated way of doing tasks under that methodology, which is proven to work.* (Ex: Scrum practice under Agile → small sprints, daily standups, retrospectives).

👉 That means: **Agile = methodology, Scrum = practice.**

Now, how do we manage these practices? Just like drivers need to know **ABC (Accelerator, Brake, Clutch)** before using a car key, software teams need tools to manage Agile practices.
And the universal tool is **Jira** – the steering wheel of Agile projects.

But tools alone are not enough. Just as knowing where the accelerator and brake are is more important than just holding the car key, knowing **SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)** is more important than simply using Jira.

That’s why today we connected Scrum → Agile → SDLC → Software Engineering principles.

And remember – becoming employable is not about memorizing definitions. It’s about connecting practices, understanding methodology, and applying them in real projects – just like Amazon does."


✨ Mentor’s Closing Thought:
*"So friends, practices may change from company to company, but the **principle** remains: a good engineer always respects methodology, follows practices, and masters the tools. That’s what makes you industry-ready, not just exam-ready."*


🧑‍🏫 *"Friends, we just discussed Scrum, Agile, and practices. Now let us zoom in on our **case study: Amazon**.*

When we look at companies, they all stand on **four pillars**:
👉 **People, Processes, Practices, Producing Products**.

Think of **Tata Group**:

* Tata Steel → produces steel.
* Tata Motors → produces vehicles.
* Tata Communications & TCS → they don’t produce a physical product, but instead **provide services**.

So companies either:

* produce **products**, or
* provide **services**, or
* sometimes do both.

Now, look at **Amazon**.
At first glance, we all know it as *Amazon.com*, an **e-commerce platform**. Customers and sellers meet there, like a digital marketplace. Amazon provides the **platform**, buyers bring money, sellers bring products, and transactions happen. Simple handshake of “give and take.”

But here’s the twist—Amazon is not just e-commerce. Behind that website there’s:

* massive **data centers**,
* high-bandwidth connectivity,
* **virtualized environments** → which we call *Amazon Cloud*.

That’s how their **online portal** works seamlessly across the globe.

Now students, pause here and think: what challenges does Amazon face?
💡 *To stay No.1, their software must be continuously improved.*
That means bug fixes, new features, performance upgrades – nonstop. That’s why they follow **Agile + Scrum practices**.

Now let’s widen our view. Amazon is not just “shopping.”

* It gives us **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** → that’s **Infrastructure & Platform as a Service**.
* It gives us **Amazon Prime Video** → that’s **digital streaming service**.
* It gives us **Alexa** → a smart gadget + AI service.

So Amazon offers:

* **Software as a Service (SaaS)** → Amazon.com, Prime, Alexa apps.
* **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** → AWS developer platforms, databases, analytics.
* **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** → EC2, storage, networking.

👉 Compare it with Tata: Tata makes steel, vehicles, metro lines. Amazon makes SaaS, PaaS, IaaS.

Other SaaS examples? Gmail, Office 365, IRCTC ticketing, YouTube, Netflix.
When you log in and use them, you don’t worry about servers or databases – the company manages everything. That’s **Software as a Service.**

So my dear friends, here’s the golden point:

* Some companies make **products**.
* Some companies give **services**.
* The modern giants like Amazon? They give **all three layers – Infrastructure, Platform, and Software as a Service.**

That’s why they dominate.

✨ Mentor’s Closing Thought:
*"Whenever you study a company like Amazon, don’t just see what they sell. See the layers behind it – people, processes, practices, platforms. That’s how you’ll think like a real **software engineer**, not just a coder."*


### 🌱 Phases of SDLC Through Life

“Think of software as if it were a **human life**. Just like a baby grows into an adult, a software solution also grows in **phases**. Let’s walk step by step.”


#### 1️⃣ **Planning – The Conception / Dream Phase**

* Just like parents **plan** before having a child (where will we live, how to raise, what future we want), software begins with **planning**.
* We decide: *What problem are we solving? Who are we solving it for? What environment will it run in (Windows app, Mobile app, Cloud app)?*
* Here we set the **roadmap**, **strategy**, and **milestones**. Example: “We want to build an online shopping application, inspired by Amazon.”


#### 2️⃣ **Requirement Gathering – The Childhood Curiosity Phase**

* Imagine a child asking: *What toys do I need? What school will I go to?*
* Similarly, we ask the business users: *What do you need in this application?*
* Cart, wishlist, payments, product catalog — these are like the **toys and essentials** that shape the child’s growth.


#### 3️⃣ **Analysis – The Schooling Phase**

* In school, children **learn rules, structures, and disciplines**.
* Here, we analyze: *Are requirements feasible? What risks exist?*
* We also decide the **SDLC model**. Since we want an **online shopping app**, we chose the **Spiral Model** (because it allows iterative improvements and risk handling).
* Methodology? **Agile** (like flexible school learning instead of rigid rote learning).
* Tools? Something like **JIRA** (like a timetable to track progress).


#### 4️⃣ **Design – The Teenage Creativity Phase**

* Teenagers start **designing their identity** — what clothes to wear, how to look, how to express themselves.
* Likewise, in software we create **architectural designs, UI/UX mockups, database schema**.
* “This is how our shopping cart should look; this is how payment flows.”
* We define **blueprints** before actual building.


#### 5️⃣ **Development – The Adulthood Working Phase**

* Now the person is grown up and starts working, producing, earning.
* In software, **coding begins**. Developers write C#, Java, Python — whichever is chosen.
* Each feature is like a **skill learned and applied**.


#### 6️⃣ **Testing – The Job Interview Phase**

* Before entering the real world, we test ourselves in exams, interviews, internships.
* Similarly, software goes through **unit testing, integration testing, user acceptance testing**.
* Only when it proves itself can it move forward.


#### 7️⃣ **Deployment – The Marriage Phase**

* Just like marriage introduces a person into a new family & society, deployment introduces the software to **users**.
* It leaves the developer’s laptop and enters the **cloud / mobile store / client’s server**.
* Now it is officially “live.”

#### 8️⃣ **Maintenance – The Parenthood Phase**

* After marriage, responsibilities come — fixing problems, adapting to changes, supporting children.
* Likewise, software requires **bug fixes, feature upgrades, performance tuning**.
* Maintenance ensures the application stays useful as the world changes.

### 🔑 Closing Thought

“See how software, like human life, is never a one-time event but a **continuous journey of growth and adaptation**?
From **planning (dreaming)** → to **maintenance (parenthood)**, every phase has its own beauty and responsibility.”



### 🌍Planning Phase of SDLC (Like Building a City)

“Imagine you are not just building a house, but a whole **city**. Would you start pouring cement without knowing how big the city is, how much it will cost, how long it will take, or who will build it?
No, right? You first **plan**. Software works the same way.”


#### 🏗️ What do we plan?

In the **Planning Phase**, we answer fundamental questions:

1. **Project Size**

   * How big is the city (software)?
   * Will it be a small colony (basic website), a large township (enterprise app), or a mega smart city (e-commerce platform like Amazon)?

2. **Project Cost (Budget)**

   * Money for land, raw material, workers.
   * In software terms:

     * Cost of **manpower** (developers, testers, architects)
     * Cost of **infrastructure** (servers, cloud, internet, tools like JIRA, IDEs)
     * Cost of **licenses** (databases, third-party libraries, frameworks)
     * Cost of **electricity, connectivity, workspace**

3. **Project Duration (Timeline)**

   * How long to build?
   * In IT, time is the real **currency**. Money may fluctuate, but time cannot be recovered.
   * That’s why we estimate: *3 months, 6 months, 1 year?*

4. **Effort Estimation**

   * How many people, how many hours of work?
   * Example: Building a city requires 500 laborers working for 2 years. Similarly, software may need 5 developers, 2 testers, 1 architect working full-time for 8 months.

5. **Resources Needed**

   * **Manpower** → Developers, Testers, Project Managers, UI/UX Designers.
   * **Infrastructure** → Computers, Servers, Internet, Cloud, Desks, Chairs.
   * **Raw Material** → In car manufacturing, steel and rubber are raw materials.

     * In software, **data is the raw material**.

       * Data → becomes **Information** → becomes **Knowledge** → becomes **Intelligence** → gives **Vision** → results in **Productivity** → leads to **Profit**.

6. **Project Staffing**

   * Who will do what?
   * Just like a city project has architects, engineers, masons, electricians.
   * In software:

     * Architect designs system.
     * Developer codes.
     * Tester verifies.
     * DevOps deploys.
     * Maintenance team sustains.

#### 💡 Key Takeaway

The **Planning Phase** is not just paperwork — it’s like drawing the **blueprint of a city**.

* Define **size** 🏙️
* Estimate **effort** ⏳
* Calculate **cost** 💰
* Plan **resources** 👩‍💻
* Assign **roles** 🧑‍🔧
* Manage **time** ⏱️

If planning is weak → the project will collapse halfway. If planning is strong → development flows smoothly like a city being built step by step.

 Nice — you were about to call out the missing piece, and you’re right to pause there.
That “one of the most important things” everyone forgets during **requirement gathering** is the **stakeholder / end-user / product owner** — the human voice that defines *why* the software must exist.

# Requirement Gathering — clean & teachable

“Alright team — we’ve finished planning: duration, cost, effort, resources. Next phase: **Requirement Gathering**.
Remember: planning decides *what* we will build; requirement gathering discovers *what the customer actually needs*.

Who participates? Not just developers. Real requirement gathering is a conversation between:

* **Stakeholders / Product Owner / Client** — the single voice of customer needs (the most important one).
* **Domain Experts / Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)** — business rules and domain detail.
* **Business Analyst (BA)** — translates business language into technical requirements.
* **UX Designer / UI** — early screens, flows and usability needs.
* **Architect / Tech Lead** — feasibility, constraints, integration points.
* **QA / Test Lead** — helps define acceptance criteria and testable requirements.
* **Operations / DevOps** — non-functional needs (deploy, scale, monitoring).
* **Legal / Compliance / Security** (if relevant) — regulations, privacy, PCI/DPA.

What we do in this phase:

1. Run stakeholder interviews & workshops — listen more, ask “why”.
2. Identify actors and primary workflows (who does what).
3. Capture **functional requirements** (features) and **non-functional requirements** (performance, security, availability).
4. Create artifacts: **SRS**, **use-cases**, **user stories**, **wireframes**, **data dictionary**, **acceptance criteria**.
5. Validate — walkthroughs with stakeholders, prototype if needed. Get **early sign-off** on must-haves.
6. Prioritize: build a backlog and rank features (MVP first).

Outputs / Deliverables:

* **SRS (Software Requirements Specification)** or a lightweight **Product Backlog** (in Agile).
* **User Stories** with Acceptance Criteria (or Use-Case documents).
* **Wireframes / Clickable prototypes**.
* **Non-functional requirements list** (SLA, RTO/RPO, max concurrent users).
* **Traceability matrix** (requirement → design → test).
* **Sign-off / stakeholder agreement** (or Product Owner acceptance).

# Quick Amazon e-commerce mapping (practical)

Actors (stakeholders): consumer, seller, advertiser, courier partner, payment gateway, admin.
Example functional requirements (short):

* Search products by name/category/filters.
* Add to cart / wishlist.
* Checkout supporting multiple payment methods (card, UPI, wallets).
* Seller portal to upload and manage inventory.
* Courier tracking & notifications.
  Example non-functional requirements:
* Support 100k concurrent users during sales.
* 99.95% availability; page load < 2s.
* PCI-DSS compliance for payments.

# How to write a good user story + acceptance criteria

User story format:

* **As a** {actor} **I want** {action} **so that** {value}.
  Example:
* As a **Buyer**, I want to **save items to wishlist** so that I can purchase them later.
  Acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then):
* Given I am a logged-in buyer, When I click “Add to Wishlist” on a product, Then the product appears in my wishlist and I see confirmation.

# Short checklist for running a requirement gathering session

* Objective of the meeting (clear).
* Who must attend (product owner present!).
* Agenda: 1) business goals 2) actors & flows 3) key features 4) non-functional needs 5) open issues 6) next steps.
* Bring sample data, competitor examples, existing logs/screens.
* Capture minutes, agreed action items, owners, and deadline for sign-off.
* Prototype key screens ASAP; validation beats long documents.

# Common pitfalls — warn your students

* No single product owner → conflicting requirements.
* Mixing wishes with requirements (capture but prioritize).
* Missing non-functional requirements (scale/security).
* Writing ambiguous requirements (“fast”, “secure” — how fast? what standard?).
* Skipping stakeholder validation — leads to rework.

# Tiny classroom exercise (practical)

“Pair up. Pick one simple Amazon feature: *Search & Buy a book*.

* Interview each other (one plays buyer, one BA) for 10 minutes.
* Write 3 user stories + acceptance criteria.
* Sketch a 2-screen wireframe (search result + checkout).
  We’ll review 3 pairs in class.”



### 🌱 Requirement Gathering with Consultants & Customers

“Team, let’s pause here. Who really sits in the room when requirements are gathered?

Not engineers. Not freshers who just passed out. This is the league of **consultants, strategists, business analysts, QA teams, domain experts, subject matter experts, and yes — the customer.**

👉 *Consultants* bring their wisdom of solving similar problems for other clients. They are not coding, but they know the playbook — what works, what fails, where the pitfalls are.

👉 *Business Analysts* translate customer needs into structured requirements. They are the bridge between business language and technical language.

👉 *Domain Experts* — say, someone who has lived and breathed e-commerce operations. They don’t write Java or C#, but they know what happens when a refund is delayed, when an inventory mismatch occurs, or when a courier API fails.

👉 *QA / Quality Assurance team* — they don’t just test later; they start early. They listen carefully and ensure requirements are **testable**, measurable, and unambiguous.

And at the center — **the customer.** But not the ‘end-user’. That’s where most beginners get confused.

Who is your real customer?

* If *Amazon* hires you, Amazon is your customer.
* The millions of buyers on Amazon? They’re end-users of Amazon’s platform.
* If a Bhajiwala in your town wants to launch **eBhaji.com**, *he is your customer.* His buyers are end-users.

This clarity is critical — otherwise, your analysis and design go in the wrong direction.

Now, imagine this chain of flow:

* **Customer** → shares needs, vision, business goals.
* **Consultant & Domain Experts** → shape those ideas into feasible, proven approaches.
* **Business Analyst** → captures them into an SRS.
* **QA** → ensures every requirement is clear, testable, and measurable.
* **Development & Testing teams** → pick up later to build, code, test, and deploy.

As a fresher, will you sit at this requirement-gathering table?
Not on Day 1. You’ll join as a **junior developer or junior tester**, watching carefully how seniors do it. You’ll learn by observing, shadowing, and asking. After years of projects, you’ll gain maturity. Then, one day, you’ll be in that very room, helping shape the requirements.

And remember — this is **Software Engineering in practice.** Not just theory for exams, not just big English words like SRS. This is how real projects avoid going off track.”

### 🎯 Practical Class Activity

**Task:** Create an SRS for your **Online Shopping Application.**

* Treat “Amazon” (or a local e-commerce business) as your **customer.**
* Define:

  * Customer’s requirements (business needs).
  * End-user requirements (buyers, sellers).
  * Functional + Non-functional requirements.
  * Clear scope and out-of-scope features.
* Submit it as input for the *Analysis & Design* team.


This way, students walk out not just knowing “SRS = Software Requirement Specification” but *experiencing the flow of who sits at the table, why consultants matter, and who the real customer is.*



### **Beyond Marks and MCQs**

“Friends, let me share one small truth with you.
To become a good developer, you don’t need to read a hundred Upanishads, novels, or heavy theory books. You just need to live like a normal, curious human being — focus on your basics, on your sessions, and understand concepts in their true spirit.

Of course, if you get time to read books, that’s an advantage. But don’t get lost thinking only books will make you great. Our sessions are here for a reason — to simplify, to practice, to prepare you.

Now, you might be wondering: *‘Sir, how will interviewers ask questions on these topics?’*
Let me tell you — in my experience, companies don’t ask you textbook definitions.

When I sit on interview panels for companies hiring freshers or even people with 5–10 years of experience, I never ask:

* What is abstraction?
* Define inheritance.
* What is software engineering?

No! Instead, I ask things like:

* Tell me about your previous project.
* Did you implement any design pattern, like Singleton?
* Why did you choose that approach?
* You used JDBC in your project — why did you pick Oracle’s driver, or why a third-party one? What’s the advantage?

See the difference?
Interviews test how you *apply* knowledge, not how you *recite* definitions.

That’s why I keep telling you — your projects are your strongest assets. If you’ve implemented object-oriented principles, if you’ve written clean code, if you’ve faced and solved real problems, those stories will carry you through.

Marks and MCQs? They help you pass exams. They’re fine for getting your degree — but a degree is just a piece of paper if you don’t back it up with real experience.

So be like an eagle. Don’t just fly low, scratching for MCQs on the ground. Fly high. See the bigger picture. Build that perspective.

Remember: the world doesn’t need engineers who only collect marks. It needs problem-solvers, builders, people who can say, *‘Yes, I’ve done this. Here’s my GitHub link. Here’s my project. Here’s how I solved this challenge.’*

So, let’s stop worrying too much about definitions or scores. Let’s focus on creating. On building. On experiencing.

Because that’s what will prepare you for the real world.”
