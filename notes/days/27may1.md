### 👨‍🏫 Software Testing

**Scene 1: Setting the Stage**
👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Om, today we’re going to explore **the complete software development ecosystem** — from SDLC to cloud environments, from coding to testing.

👦 **Om:** Sir, that sounds huge. Can we really see all of it in one session?

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Absolutely. Think of it like visiting a factory that builds **online applications** like Gmail, Google Docs, Amazon, or Facebook. You’ll see every stage — planning, designing, developing, testing, and deploying.

**Scene 2: Software Development Processes**

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Om, first, let’s understand **SDLC — Software Development Life Cycle**.

* Requirement analysis → SRS document by domain experts.
* High-Level Design → Architect visualizes using **UML diagrams, flow diagrams, sequence diagrams**.
* Development → Front-end, back-end, database developers write source code.

👦 **Om:** So, the architect doesn’t code?

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Correct. The architect converts business requirements into **blueprints**. Developers then bring these blueprints to life.

**Scene 3: Collaboration Tools**

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Now, think about sharing this source code. How do developers collaborate?

👦 **Om:** GitHub?

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Exactly. In the old days, companies used **TFS, SVN, Tortoise**, all proprietary. Today, GitHub is **public, centralized, and collaborative**.

* You **git add, commit, push, pull** — it should become like breathing.
* Like inhaling and exhaling, your **source control workflow** should feel natural.

👦 **Om:** Wow, so GitHub is literally life support for developers!

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** You got it! Without it, even the best code can’t reach production efficiently.

**Scene 4: The Development Team**

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Om, let’s walk through the **roles in a development team**:

1. **UI Designer** → Crafts user interface, looks, and feel.
2. **Developer/Programmer** → Writes code in C, Java, TypeScript, etc.
3. **Release Team** → Compiles, builds, and packages code into **executables or containers**.
4. **Tester/QA Team** → Validates the software before it reaches users.

👦 **Om:** Sir, Release Team sounds like chefs in a kitchen!

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Perfect analogy! Imagine:

* Ingredients = source code
* Cooking = compiling, building, linking
* Ready dish = executable or container ready for testing/deployment

**Scene 5: Continuous Integration & Delivery**

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Om, modern software doesn’t sit idle. It’s **continuously developed, integrated, and tested**.

* CI/CD pipelines automate building, testing, and deploying code.
* Every new feature goes through **automated tests** before reaching users.

👦 **Om:** So, the software evolves constantly, like apps we use daily?

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Exactly! Gmail, Google Docs, Amazon Prime — all constantly upgraded through CI/CD processes.

**Scene 6: Importance of Requirements & Architects**

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Remember Om, without **requirements from customers**, nothing moves.

👦 **Om:** So, architects are only as important as the requirements?

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Spot on. Requirement → Architect → Design → Development → Release → Testing → Users.

* Without **customers**, architects, IT teams, and developers have no work.
* Necessity is the mother of innovation.

**Scene 7: Closing Insights**

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Om, the big takeaway:

* **Software development is a coordinated ecosystem**.
* GitHub, CI/CD, UML, SDLC, architects, developers, testers — all **play a vital role**.
* Every role is important, just like in a factory or a kitchen — from prep to plating, every step counts.

👦 **Om:** Sir, I understand. It’s not just coding — it’s a **whole process that needs coordination, planning, and continuous improvement**.

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Exactly. And if you grasp this, you won’t just be a coder — you’ll be an **engineering professional who understands the entire lifecycle**.

### 👨‍🏫 Application Development, Packging, Testing and Deployment

**Scene 1: Release Team and Binary Images**

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Om, imagine this — all the source code our developers write eventually needs to be turned into **binary deployables**: EXEs, DLLs, container images. Who does this?

👦 **Om:** Sir, the Release Team?

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Exactly! They’re like chefs in a kitchen — taking all ingredients (source code), compiling, linking, and creating a **ready-to-serve dish**. These binaries are what the testing team and eventually users will interact with.

**Scene 2: Software Testing Team — The Guardians of Quality**

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Now, Om, once the binary is ready, who ensures it’s perfect?

👦 **Om:** The testers, QA team?

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Yes! And not just QA experts — sometimes customers themselves test the software, especially in beta programs. The goal? **0-defect product**.

👦 **Om:** 0-defect product? Sir, does that mean absolutely no bugs?

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Precisely. The product should work as intended for **every end user**. Think Gmail, WhatsApp, or Google Maps. Users expect the service to run smoothly, every single time.

**Scene 3: Product as a Service**

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Om, today, most software isn’t just an application anymore. It’s a **service**.

* Gmail → Gmail Service
* WhatsApp → Messaging Service
* Google Docs → Document Service

👦 **Om:** So the software itself is a service provided to users?

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Exactly. And the **provider** — the company — ensures the service runs smoothly and meets user expectations.

**Scene 4: Importance of Every Team Member**

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Om, can **one person deliver a 0-defect product**?

👦 **Om:** No sir, it requires a team — developers, testers, architects, release engineers.

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Spot on! Each role is critical. The architect designs, developers build, release engineers package, testers validate. Every member contributes to **quality and reliability**.

**Scene 5: Myths About Testers**

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Om, here’s a common myth: “Testers don’t grow in their career or earn less than developers.”

👦 **Om:** Sir, I’ve heard that too.

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Totally wrong. I have friends in testing who earn **more than some developers**, especially in critical domains like aviation, manufacturing, or robotics.

👦 **Om:** Really?

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Yes. A single bug in software controlling robots in a car factory could **stop the entire production line**. Testers prevent such disasters. Companies pay well for expertise that ensures **0-defect delivery**.

**Scene 6: Career Growth in Testing**

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Think about it, Om. Testers:

* Understand the product deeply.
* Ensure customer expectations are met.
* Control unnecessary code that might create issues.

👦 **Om:** So testers are actually the **guardians of product quality**?

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Absolutely. And in the IT industry, experienced testers can earn high salaries and have excellent career growth — same as developers.

**Scene 7: Real-Life Example**

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Om, take **Cybage** — a company that recruits students from SIDAC. Out of 50–60 selected students, **half were software testers** and they got **the same salary** as developers.

👦 **Om:** Wow! That really breaks the myth.

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Exactly! So remember, in software development:

> “Every role is essential — architect, developer, release engineer, tester. And testers are **key to delivering zero-defect products**, ensuring customer satisfaction, and business success.”


✅ **Takeaways**:

1. **Release Team** → Converts code into deployable binaries.
2. **Tester/QA Team** → Ensures 0-defect product, validates customer expectations.
3. **Software as a Service** → Product evolves into consumable service.
4. **Every Role is Critical** → Collaboration ensures product quality and reliability.
5. **Testers Have Career Growth** → High demand in critical domains; paid well.

“Remember, Om, software engineering is not just coding. It’s a team sport — every member contributes to delivering 0-defect software to real users.
Whether you start as a tester, developer, or DevOps engineer, your dedication, learning, and collaboration determine your growth.
And always remember: the ecosystem works together — miss one piece, and the product fails.

### 👨‍🏫 Mentor Reflection

**Scene: Reflecting on Early Career & Importance of Software Testing**

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Let me take you back, Om, to **1998**. That was the first time I conducted a session at **CDAC ACTS, Nasik**. I was teaching **VC++ (Visual C++)**, and the students were full of curiosity and energy.

I still remember that batch clearly — smiling faces, eager minds, and a lot of potential. Most of those students today are **working in top positions in the US** — architects at Oracle, Microsoft, IBM. Some became trainers themselves, some lead entire teams. But what’s interesting is the **journey of one of my students, Lalkar Chaidwelkar**.

**Scene: Lalkar’s Journey — From Tester to Leader**

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Lalkar started as a **tester in Sybase in 1999**. Not as a developer, not as an architect — a **tester**.

He immersed himself in **quality assurance**:

* Understood **system requirement analysis**
* Prepared **test plans**
* Wrote **countless test cases**
* Learned the art of delivering a **0-defect product**

Over **20 years**, Lalkar rose to **lead the QA team**, later running his own **product-based company**, supporting clients with **high-quality software**, and even running an **NGO** alongside his brother.

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** The lesson here, Om? **Software testing is not a low-profile career**. Lalkar earned as much — if not more — than developers with equivalent experience. His expertise was recognized because he understood **the value of 0-defect products**.

**Scene: Debunking Myths About Testing**

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** I often hear students say, “Tester roles don’t have career growth.” That is **completely wrong**.

* Manual testers who never upgraded their skills may plateau.
* But testing has **many specializations**:

  * Automation testing
  * Regression testing
  * Integration testing
  * Load testing
  * White-box, black-box, grey-box testing

The key is **continuous learning and upgrading your skillset**. That’s what separates a **top-tier QA professional** from someone stuck in the comfort zone.

**Scene: Role of CDAC / TAP Courses**

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Now, this is where courses like TAP come into play. They prepare you as an **IT professional** — not just a developer or tester.

Companies look at such candidates and decide:
* Can this person be a **developer**?
* Can this person be a **tester**?
* Can this person become a **DevOps engineer**?
* Can this person become a **system architect**?

Why? Because you’ve been trained in **core fundamentals**: coding, software engineering, testing, deployment. So companies spend **less time grooming you** for your role.

**Scene: Understanding the Ecosystem**
👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Let’s look at the **IT ecosystem**:

* **Architects** design the solution.
* **Developers** write the code.
* **Release team** packages binaries, deployables, containers.
* **Testers/QA** ensure 0-defect products.
* **Operations team** maintains, monitors, and administers systems.
* **DevOps team** ensures continuous integration and delivery.

Om, this is like a **police department**:
* You cannot have only IPS officers and no head constables.
* Each role is crucial for the force to function.
👦 **Om:** So, every role is equally important in delivering quality software?
 
 **Scene: Key Takeaways for Mentees**

1. **Starting as a tester is not limiting** — Lalkar’s journey proves it.
2. **Testing is a critical skill** — understanding QA and 0-defect delivery ensures career growth.
3. **Continuous learning is key** — manual testing alone is not enough. Automation, regression, and other testing skills elevate your profile.
4. **IT ecosystem is collaborative** — developers, testers, release, operations, DevOps, architects — all work together.
5. **TAP courses equip you for multiple roles** — making you adaptable and valuable to companies.

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:** Remember, Om, in the real world, companies hire **professionals, not just coders**. They want people who understand the **entire lifecycle** — coding, testing, deployment, operations. That’s where your career truly grows.
 

# 👨‍🏫 Career Roles in IT & How to Approach Them

**Mentor:**
“Listen carefully everyone. In the IT industry, you have many paths. You can **focus on development**, you can **focus on release**, you can **focus on software testing**, you can join the **operations team**, or you can **focus on DevOps**.

When you start your career, you might be hired as a **developer**, a **tester**, an **operations engineer**, or a **DevOps engineer**. But here’s the key — **your role depends on the company’s requirement, not just your preference.**

So, what should you do? You **prepare yourself** as a good professional in multiple dimensions:

* Be a **good tester**
* Be a **good developer**
* Be a **good operations engineer**
* Be a **good build/release engineer**

Let the company evaluate your skill, and based on that, they will place you in the **right team**.


### **1️⃣ How Companies Decide Your Role**

For example:

* If a company finds you **strong in quality assurance**, you may be injected into the **software testing team**.
* If you show strong **coding skills and architecture understanding**, you may be molded into a **developer role**.
* If your **administration skills and Linux/Windows command** are solid, the company might consider you for the **operations team**.
* If you understand **cloud computing, automation, and deployment**, you may be positioned as a **DevOps engineer**.

Sometimes, candidates may not fully fit any role initially. Then, companies might provide **3 months of training** and see who excels in development, testing, or operations. **Your performance during this period decides your placement.**

### **2️⃣ Choosing a Role After Training**

Rohit, let me give you clarity here — many students wonder: *“After TAP, which role should I focus on?”*

Here’s the answer:

* If you **own a company**, you decide your role. Developer, tester, manager, director — it’s your choice.
* But most of us **work in someone else’s company**, and that company has its **requirements and culture**. They need developers, testers, architects, operations engineers — and they **evaluate you** to decide the best fit.

Companies check:

* Your **coding skills**
* Your **GitHub projects**
* Your **understanding of object-oriented programming and architecture**

Based on this, they **offer you a role** — developer, tester, or operations engineer. Then, you decide whether to accept it.


### **3️⃣ Don’t Be Choosy — Focus on Skill First**

Here’s my advice:

* Don’t get stuck thinking: “I only want to be a developer” or “I only want to test.”
* Learn all concepts **well in TAP course**: coding, debugging, object orientation, architecture, testing, deployment.
* Work on **mini-projects**, put them on **GitHub**, and showcase your skills.

If you start as a **tester**, but you also have strong development skills, you can **later transition into a developer role**.


### **4️⃣ Real Examples — Career Transition**

I’ve seen this many times:

* People start as **life faculty/trainers** for a few years.
* They work on **coding projects on the side**.
* After demonstrating skills via **GitHub and projects**, they transition into **developer roles**.
* Some eventually become **architects** or **solution designers**.

It’s not magic — it’s **consistent performance, learning, and showcasing your work.**


### **5️⃣ Key Takeaways**

1. **Start prepared** — learn development, testing, operations, DevOps fundamentals.
2. **Be flexible** — companies will place you where they need you most.
3. **Showcase your work** — mini-projects on GitHub are proof of your ability.
4. **Transition is possible** — a tester today can become a developer tomorrow if you perform consistently.
5. **Performance speaks louder than preference** — focus on learning, the role will follow.


**Mentor:**
“So Akshay, Rohit, everyone — if you focus on fundamentals, showcase your projects, and perform consistently, **the company will notice your capability**, and if your heart is in development, you can still move from testing to development.

The path is open — **what matters is your preparation, skill, and consistency.**



# 👨‍🏫 From SDLC to Career Roles in IT

**Mentor:**
“Good morning everyone! Today, I want to share something very important about how careers in IT really work. This is not theory — this comes from my personal experience, the people I’ve mentored, and real-life examples from the industry.

### **1️⃣ Understanding SDLC & Roles in a Team**

First, let’s understand a software project. Once developers finish coding, the **release team** takes over. They create **binary images, deployable files, EXEs, DLLs**, anything that will run in the real world.

After that, the **QA or testing team** steps in. Their job? Make the software **0-defect** — a product so reliable that end-users won’t face issues. Sometimes even customers themselves test the product!

Remember, a **product today is a service** — Gmail service, WhatsApp service, Google app service. Users don’t care about the code; they care that the **service works flawlessly**.

Every team — developers, testers, release engineers, operations, DevOps — contributes to delivering a **0-defect product**. This is why each role is equally important.

### **2️⃣ Breaking Myths About Testers**

Many students ask me: *“Tester doesn’t have growth. Tester gets less salary. Tester has no career.”*

Let me tell you a story: In 1998, I conducted my first session at TAP, Nasik. One of my students, **Lalkar Chedwalkar**, started as a **tester**.

* He joined Sybase’s testing team in 1999.
* Over 20 years, he became the **head of quality assurance**.
* He now runs his **own product-based company** and supports QA teams in multiple companies.
* He earns as much, or more, than top developers.

The lesson? **It’s not the role, it’s what you do in that role.** If you master **testing concepts**, QA, automation, system analysis, and 0-defect delivery, your career will skyrocket.


### **3️⃣ How Companies Decide Your Role**

Now, coming to **your career after TAP**:

Companies don’t care about your preference; they care about **your skill fit**:

* Strong in **QA → Testing team**
* Strong in **coding and architecture → Developer team**
* Strong in **Linux/Windows admin → Operations team**
* Strong in **cloud, deployment, automation → DevOps team**

Sometimes they’ll give **3 months of training** to see where you excel. Your **performance during training decides placement**.

### **4️⃣ Don’t Be Choosy — Focus on Skill First**

Many students say, *“I only want to be a developer.”*
Wrong approach! Learn everything:

* Development
* Testing
* Operations
* DevOps fundamentals

Work on **mini-projects**, put them on **GitHub**, and **showcase your skills**. Even if you start as a tester, you can **transition to development** later.

### **5️⃣ Real-Life Career Transitions**

I’ve seen it many times:

* Life faculty/trainers started **teaching first**, then learned coding on the side.
* They built **GitHub projects**, demonstrated skills, and **transitioned into developers**.
* Some eventually became **architects or solution designers**.

It’s **consistent performance and skill demonstration** that makes this possible.

### **6️⃣ Key Takeaways**

1. **Start prepared** — learn all fundamentals.
2. **Be flexible** — companies place you where needed.
3. **Showcase your work** — mini-projects, GitHub, practical application.
4. **Transition is possible** — tester today, developer tomorrow.
5. **Performance over preference** — skills open doors.


**Mentor:**
“So everyone, the path is open. Focus on **learning, consistency, and project work**. The company will recognize your talent. And if your heart is in development, you can move from testing to development — it’s all about preparation and skill.

Remember, IT is not about the role you start with; it’s about the **capability you demonstrate, and the value you deliver.**


# 👨‍🏫 The Critical Importance of Software Testing

**Mentor:**
“Alright students, listen carefully — I want to share some **real-life examples** that show why software testing is not optional, it is **critical**.

Let’s start with cars. Back in the day, certain manufacturers had to **recall entire batches of cars** because a **software bug** wasn’t caught during testing. Imagine the money invested in the **manufacturing plant, parts, labor, everything** — all that got impacted. And on top of that, these companies had to **spend huge amounts on maintenance and bug fixes**.

Now, think about the everyday user — people in India or elsewhere, with smaller budgets. They **cannot absorb these costs** or fight back. This is why the software must be **rigorously tested before release**.

### **Example 1: Financial Software Failure**

“In 2015, the Bloomberg Terminal in London **crashed** due to a software bug. Around **300,000 traders** were affected, and billions of dollars were at risk because prices were calculated incorrectly.

It wasn’t even a financial software error per se — it was a **vulnerability in Windows 10**. A small bug on an operating system led to a **huge ripple effect**. Can you imagine the impact? Millions of dollars lost just because **testing wasn’t perfect**.

This teaches a critical lesson: **data is currency now**. Money alone is not the most important asset — **your data is your fuel**. If your software mishandles data, your business can literally collapse.

### **Example 2: Operating System Vulnerabilities**

“Let’s talk about operating systems. Microsoft Windows sometimes faces challenges because vulnerabilities might reach the end user. That’s why people trust **Mac PCs** more — Apple **prevents vulnerabilities before release**. Their testing and QA processes ensure that the **end-user data remains safe**.

Think about it — if your **financial spreadsheets** are corrupted due to a bug in your OS, **your business is at risk**. Testing is **not just coding correctness**, it’s **protecting real-world outcomes**.


### **Example 3: Military & Space Programs**

“Software bugs can have **astronomical consequences**. Imagine a military satellite launch — a **1.2 billion dollar failure** happened because of a bug in a data structure. A **for loop ran one extra iteration**, a data structure got corrupted, and the entire calculation went wrong.

You see, a program that gives **wrong results** is much worse than a program that crashes. A wrong result can silently **destroy trust, money, and operations**.

### **Example 4: Education Systems**

“Even online examination systems are **not immune**. Imagine an exam platform used by **500,000 students** across India. A single **software bug** can create chaos — students can lose marks, exams may have to be **rescheduled**, and administrators face enormous pressure.

All because the software was **not tested thoroughly**.


### **Mentor Takeaway**

“Students, here’s the key lesson from all these examples:

1. **Testing is not optional** — it protects users, businesses, and society.
2. A **minor bug** can lead to **major financial, operational, and reputational losses**.
3. **Data integrity is critical** — treat every piece of software as if it’s controlling millions of dollars or lives.
4. Always **use proper data structures, loops, and algorithms**; validate your output.
5. Software that gives wrong results is a **serious bug**, even if it doesn’t crash.

So next time you write code, remember: **you are not just coding, you are protecting users and businesses**. Software testing is your shield, your responsibility, and your power.

# 👨‍🏫 Advantages & Types of Software Testing


**Mentor:**
“Alright students, let’s continue. I want to make one thing very clear: **software testing is not just a process, it is a responsibility.**

Imagine this — a system fails **twice in front of users**. The trust in that system is gone. Once trust is lost, people hesitate to use it again. That’s why **testing is critical**, not optional.

### **Why Software Testing is Important**

“When you build an application, don’t just think about the reference books, coding, or features. Think about the **customer benefit**, **data safety**, and **real-world usage**.

Business software is extremely **volatile**. One second it works, the next second it may fail. And that can have huge consequences on **users, money, and reputation**.

That’s why **software testing is a method** — a systematic way to **identify errors, gaps, and missing requirements**, not just to ‘click buttons’ or ‘run the program’.

### **Different Types of Testing**

“Now, let’s talk about types of testing:

1. **White Box Testing (Glass Box Testing)**

   * You **look inside the code**. Check logic, loops, conditions, data structures.
   * Example: Ensuring your for loop doesn’t run one extra iteration, avoiding calculation errors.

2. **Black Box Testing**

   * You test **without looking at the code**. Focus on **inputs and outputs**.
   * Example: Does the login system allow correct users and block incorrect ones?

3. **Grey Box Testing**

   * A **mix of both**. You know some internal details, but you primarily test from the **user’s perspective**.

“We’ll focus mainly on **white box and black box testing** in this session because they form the foundation of all testing practices.


### **Advantages of Software Testing**

“Now let’s discuss **why testing is crucial** in the software development life cycle. Think along with me:

1. **Cost Effectiveness**

   * If you **test before delivery**, you save money on **maintenance and bug fixes later**.
   * Example: Imagine a car manufactured, delivered to a customer, and it fails on the road. Repairing it later costs **far more than fixing it during testing**.

2. **Time Effectiveness**

   * Early detection of bugs saves **time for developers and QA**. The development cycle becomes smoother.

3. **Product Quality**

   * A well-tested product ensures **high quality**.
   * Example: People prefer **Japanese cars**, **German watches**, or **Sony electronics** because of rigorous testing in manufacturing.
   * Quality is about **meeting requirements consistently**. Following standards like **ISO 9000** ensures quality assurance in software.

4. **Customer Satisfaction**

   * The software should provide a **good user interface (UI)** and **user experience (UX)**.
   * Example: Amazon.com — even my **10-year-old twins** can search for a toy, place an order, and complete checkout without guidance. That’s **excellent usability**, achieved through rigorous testing.

5. **Security**

   * Software should **only perform intended tasks** and protect **user data**.
   * Example: If a payment app steals credit card info, users lose trust instantly. Testing ensures the software is **secure and reliable**.

### **Mentor Note**

“So students, remember: **software testing is not just about finding bugs.**

It ensures:

* Cost savings for companies
* High product quality
* Excellent user satisfaction
* Data security and integrity

All these factors make software testing **an essential pillar** of software development.

**Mentor:**
“Next, we’ll dive into **different kinds of testing techniques, strategies, and how to implement them effectively in real projects**.

Always remember: **a tested software is a trusted software.** And trust is the most valuable thing in any business or application.”


# 👨‍🏫Types of Software Testing

**Mentor:**
“Alright students, now we’re entering an important part of software testing — **the types of testing**.

When we say ‘software testing,’ it’s not just a single activity. There are **different types of testing**, and each has its own purpose. The goal is always to **check the quality of your product** — whether it meets the **requirements**, whether it does **only what it should**, and whether it maintains **reliability and performance**.

To understand this, let’s refer back to our **SRS document**. In the SRS, we define **functional requirements** and **non-functional requirements**. Based on these, testing is divided into **functional testing** and **non-functional testing**.

### **1️⃣ Functional Testing**

“Functional testing focuses on **what the software is supposed to do**.

* Example: Imagine an **online shopping application**.

  * We write code for **product catalog**, **shopping cart**, **order processing**.
  * Each of these is a **unit** — a small piece of software that performs a specific function.

**Unit Testing:**

* Checks each unit independently.
* Does my `addToCart()` function work as expected?
* Does my `calculateTotal()` function return correct totals?

**Integration Testing:**

* Now we check **how units work together**.
* Does the shopping cart correctly read product details from the product catalog?
* Do all modules combined give the **expected result**?

**Smoke Testing:**

* A quick, basic check to see whether the **critical functions of the software work** before deeper testing begins.

**Key point:** In functional testing, you **take every functional requirement** from your SRS and verify it. If your product fulfills the requirement, it passes the test.

### **2️⃣ Non-Functional Testing**

“Non-functional testing checks **how well the software performs**, not just whether it works.

* Example: Back to our **online shopping application**:

  * How fast does the product catalog load when I select a category?
  * Can the system handle **10,000 users** browsing at the same time?
  * Does the search function return results within **2 seconds**?

Other aspects of non-functional testing include:

* **Performance testing** — speed, responsiveness
* **Security testing** — protect user data and prevent unauthorized access
* **Usability testing** — easy navigation and user-friendly interface

**Key point:** Functional testing ensures the **software works correctly**, while non-functional testing ensures it **works efficiently, securely, and reliably**.

### **Mentor Note**

“So students, always remember:

* **Functional testing = correctness** (does it do what it should?)
* **Non-functional testing = quality attributes** (performance, security, usability)

Without both, your software can fail in the real world, even if it ‘runs’ perfectly in isolation.


**Mentor:**
“In the next session, we will go deeper into **functional and non-functional testing techniques**, show **real-world examples**, and discuss **how testing prevents catastrophic failures** like Y2K or Bloomberg Terminal crashes.

Always keep this in mind: **testing is not optional; it’s your responsibility to ensure software reliability, performance, and trustworthiness.**



# 👨‍🏫 Non-Functional Testing & Endurance

**Mentor:**
“Alright students, now that we’ve discussed **functional testing** — which ensures your software **does what it’s supposed to do** — let’s talk about **non-functional testing**.

Non-functional testing focuses on **how well your software performs** rather than just **whether it works**.

Some key aspects of non-functional testing are:

1. **Performance** – How fast your application responds.
2. **Scalability** – Can it handle increasing users or load?
3. **Endurance (Stamina)** – Can your system **keep running reliably under sustained load**?
4. **Security** – Does it protect data from unauthorized access?
5. **Availability** – Is it always up, 24/7?
6. **Durability & Maintainability** – Can it last and be maintained over time?

### **Endurance Testing Example**

“Think about an **online shopping website**. On normal days, it handles maybe **1000 requests per second**. But during **Diwali or Christmas**, thousands of users log in simultaneously to place orders — let’s say **7000 requests per second**.

* If the website **still works without crashing**, it demonstrates **endurance**.
* It’s just like lifting dumbbells in the gym:

  * If you can lift 20 kg repeatedly without failing, your **stamina** is good.
  * Similarly, if the website can handle high load for a long time, its **endurance is fantastic**.

Endurance testing ensures the system can **sustain operations under heavy stress for long periods**, not just survive a momentary spike.


### **Other Non-Functional Examples**

* **Load Testing:** Check the system’s behavior under expected heavy load.

* **Deployment Testing / Maintenance Testing:** After deploying software, ensure it **runs correctly on production servers**, also called **regression testing**.

* **Availability:** System should run **24x7 without crash**.

* **Security:** Prevents data theft and unauthorized access.


### **Mentor Note**

“So remember:

* Functional testing = correctness (**does it do what it should?**)
* Non-functional testing = quality (**does it perform well, reliably, securely?**)
* Endurance is a **critical part of non-functional testing** — your system’s ability to **keep going under pressure**.

If your website **fails during peak traffic**, all your functional correctness won’t matter. That’s why **endurance, scalability, and performance testing** are just as important as unit tests and integration tests.



# 👨‍🏫 Principles of Software Testing & Understanding Over Memorization

**Mentor:**
“Alright students, now that we have understood **functional and non-functional testing**, including endurance, performance, and scalability, let’s talk about **software testing principles**.

First, a reminder: testing is not just about **running code and finding bugs**. It’s about **ensuring quality, security, reliability, and customer satisfaction**.

Think of it this way: just like we **test cars, appliances, and electronic gadgets** before they reach the customer, **software needs similar testing rigor**. You don’t want your user to face issues after paying for the product — that destroys trust and business.”


### **Silent Features of Non-Functional Testing**

“Here’s an important point — non-functional testing often checks **silent features**. What does that mean?

* Test your software from **multiple devices**.
* Test your **database servers** for uptime.
* Test your **endurance** — can the system handle high traffic during festivals like Diwali or Christmas?
* Ensure **performance, reliability, and security**.

These are the **invisible strengths** that make a software product robust, even if the end-user doesn’t directly see them.”

### **Learning vs Memorizing**

“Students, here’s a golden rule:

* In engineering colleges, many of you **memorized definitions** without understanding.
* You might have scored marks, but when you joined the job, you **struggled to apply knowledge**.

Here, our focus is **understanding first**.

If you **understand** the principle of testing — like why we do endurance testing or how functional testing ensures correctness — you **don’t need to memorize**.

Your brain will **automatically retain** the concepts because you’ve experienced and connected them with real-life examples.”


### **Principles of Software Testing**

“Just like in **Object-Oriented Programming**, we have pillars like:

* **Abstraction**
* **Encapsulation**
* **Inheritance**
* **Polymorphism**

…we also have **7 principles of software testing**.

* Don’t worry about memorizing the number or names.
* Focus on **understanding each principle** — what it achieves and why it matters.
* Once you understand, it becomes **second nature**, just like knowing how a car engine works without reading the manual every time.

Remember: **understanding > memorization**. That’s the key to becoming a skilled software professional.”

# 👨‍🏫 7 Principles of Software Testing

**Mentor:**
“Alright students, now we are ready to explore the **7 key principles of software testing**. Think of these as the **do’s and don’ts**, the **guiding pillars** of quality testing.

Just like in engineering, where we follow **laws and standards**, software testing also has principles that help us **do the right thing efficiently**.”

### **Principle #1 – Exhaustive Testing is Impossible**

“Imagine this: your online shopping application has **10 features**.

* You can probably test **9 of them thoroughly**, but testing **every single scenario** is practically impossible.
* Why? Because **time, cost, and resources are limited**.

So remember: **100% testing is impossible**. Our goal is **maximal coverage** within constraints.”

### **Principle #2 – Defect Clustering**

“Not all parts of a software have equal risk.

* Some modules, like **shopping cart** or **payment gateway**, are **more defect-prone**.
* Others, like a **static help page**, have fewer defects.

This is called **defect clustering**: defects are **clustered in a few critical areas**.

✅ Practical Tip: **Identify risky modules first and focus more tests there**. This ensures we catch the critical bugs efficiently.”

### **Principle #3 – Pesticide Paradox**

“This one is interesting and comes from farming.

* Imagine a farmer spraying the **same pesticide repeatedly**. Over time, the **pests become resistant**.
* In software testing, if you **run the same tests repeatedly**, they eventually **stop finding new defects**.

This is the **pesticide paradox**: **you need to regularly review and update your test cases** to uncover new bugs.”

### **Principle #4 – Early Testing**

“Testing should start **as early as possible** in the software lifecycle.

* If you find defects **early**, they are **cheaper and easier to fix**.
* Waiting until the product is fully developed increases **cost and effort**.

Think of it like **detecting a crack in the car chassis during assembly**, rather than after the customer drives it off the lot.”

### **Principle #5 – Testing Shows Presence of Defects**

“Testing can **show that defects exist**, but **cannot prove that software is completely defect-free**.

* Even after testing, some hidden bugs may remain.
* That’s why **risk management and prioritization** are important.”

### **Principle #6 – Absence of Errors is a Fallacy**

“Just because no defects are found doesn’t mean the software is perfect.

* A product could be **free from known bugs**, yet still **fail to meet business requirements**.
* Always focus on **requirements validation**, not just defect counts.”

### **Principle #7 – Context-Dependent Testing**

“Testing is **not one-size-fits-all**.

* The approach depends on **the type of software, the users, the environment, and business needs**.
* Example: testing a **banking app** is different from testing a **game app**.

✅ Key Insight: **Adapt your testing strategy to the context**.”

**Mentor:**
“So these are the **7 guiding principles of software testing**:

1. Exhaustive testing is impossible
2. Defect clustering
3. Pesticide paradox
4. Early testing
5. Testing shows presence of defects
6. Absence of errors is a fallacy
7. Context-dependent testing

If you **understand these principles**, you’ll naturally know **how, when, and where to test**, rather than just memorizing definitions.”


# 👨‍🏫 Advanced Software Testing Principles

**Mentor:**
“Alright friends, now let’s imagine a real-world scenario. Think about **Microsoft**. Microsoft creates **Windows**, an operating system.

* Microsoft has **thoroughly tested Windows** before releasing it.
* But as a tester, **you are not going to test the same operating system every time** someone installs it. Why? Because testing everything repeatedly **wastes time and effort**.

Here, we apply the **pesticide paradox**: just like pests can develop resistance to the same pesticide, software stops revealing new bugs if you **run the same tests repeatedly**.

✅ **Lesson:** We need to **review, revise, and rewrite our test cases** to discover new bugs. Continuous innovation in testing is key.”

### **Continuous Testing Example**

“Think of the **coronavirus pandemic**.

* The virus mutates over time. Scientists must **continuously create new tests** to detect new strains.
* Similarly, in software testing, as the system evolves or requirements change, testers must **continuously write and update test cases**.

🔑 Key Principle: **Continuous testing and continuous integration** are critical for catching new defects early.”

### **Testing Shows Presence of Defects**

“Always remember, the purpose of testing is **to find defects**, not to prove perfection.

* Just because your software passes all tests doesn’t mean it’s completely bug-free.
* The goal is to **identify defects before they impact users**.

Think of testing as a **safety net**: it catches problems early so developers can fix them.”

### **Early Testing**

“Testing shouldn’t wait until development is complete. Start **as early as the SRS document is ready**.

* Example: When you gather requirements, **plan your test cases simultaneously**.
* This way, testing guides development toward **zero-defect software** rather than finding defects after release.”

### **Context-Dependent Testing**

“Not all software is the same. Consider:

* An **online library system**
* An **online shopping app**
* An **online examination system**

Each has **unique requirements, users, and workflows**.

✅ **Lesson:** Testing strategies must be **tailored to the context**.

* If you test an online exam system, that doesn’t automatically teach you how to test a shopping system.
* Always think about **who is using the software** and **how they interact with it**.

This is where **abstraction** comes in: focus on **essential characteristics** relevant to each user type—like a driver vs. a conductor on a bus analogy. Each sees the system differently, so your tests must adapt.”

### **Verification vs. Validation**

“When learning software testing, you’ll encounter **two critical terms**:

1. **Verification:** Are we building the product **right**? (Following requirements, design, and standards)
2. **Validation:** Are we building the **right product**? (Does it meet customer needs?)

* Verification is like **checking the blueprint**.
* Validation is like **checking if the house works for its occupants**.

Both are essential for high-quality software.”

### **Domain & Process Knowledge**

“A great tester must know:

* **Domain knowledge:** E-commerce, banking, healthcare, etc.
* **Technical knowledge:** Languages, frameworks, architecture.
* **Process knowledge:** Software lifecycle, requirement gathering, deployment.

✅ **Reason:** This allows testers to **predict potential bugs** before developers even write code.

* Example: In TDD (Test-Driven Development), you write tests first to **guide the development process** and prevent defects.”

### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Pesticide Paradox:** Update tests to catch new defects.
2. **Continuous Testing:** Always evolving test scenarios.
3. **Testing Shows Presence of Defects:** Goal is to detect bugs early.
4. **Early Testing:** Start testing alongside requirement gathering.
5. **Context-Dependent Testing:** Different software requires different strategies.
6. **Verification & Validation:** Ensure product is built right and is the right product.
7. **Domain & Process Knowledge:** Predict potential bugs proactively.


**Mentor:**
“So, when you approach software testing, remember: **your goal is not to break the developer’s code, but to make the product robust, reliable, and user-ready**. You think like a **tester, a domain expert, and a guide for developers**—all at once.

Testing is **creative, continuous, and context-aware**. If you understand this, every software you test will become a **high-quality product**.”

# 👨‍🏫Test-Driven Development (TDD) Explained
 

**Mentor:**
“Alright friends, now let’s think about **companies as demand-driven organizations**. You want developers who **know TDD**—Test-Driven Development.

* TDD means **writing tests before writing the actual code**.
* You don’t start coding first; you start by **understanding requirements, defining constraints, and writing tests** based on functional and non-functional requirements.

Think about it like **vaccine development**.”

### **Vaccination Analogy**

“Imagine the world faced **coronavirus**. Multinational pharmaceutical companies didn’t immediately have a vaccine.

* Why? There was **no problem definition yet**.
* Once scientists **defined the problem**, they designed **tests to understand the virus**, including mutations.
* These tests guided pharmaceutical companies to **develop effective vaccines like Covaxin**—and they did it in **less than a year**, compared to the French flu vaccine which took **5–6 years**!

✅ Lesson: **Writing tests first accelerates development**.”


### **TDD in Software**

“Now apply this to software development:

1. Gather your **SRS (Software Requirement Specification)**.
2. Understand functional and non-functional requirements.
3. Define **test scenarios** and **expected outputs**.
4. Only then, ask the developer to write code according to your tests.

* The developer now writes **code aligned with the test expectations**, reducing defects and rework.
* Without TDD, developers may write code, then testers find **80% of functions with bugs**, wasting a lot of time.
* With TDD, development is **faster, cleaner, and more reliable**.”

### **Writing a Test Case**

“Let’s look at an example:

**Model:** Membership model for an online shopping app.
**Scenario:** User Authentication

1. **Define Input:**

   * Username
   * Password

2. **Define Expected Output:**

   * Valid user → Access granted
   * Invalid user → Access denied

3. **Test Cases:**

   * Test 1: Username: Ravi, Password: seed → Output: valid user
   * Test 2: Username: Sachin, Password: IBM → Output: valid user
   * Test 3: …

Notice:

* We are **not defining how the code will work**, only **what is expected input and output**.
* Multiple **test instances** can be created for the same scenario with **different data**.

This is the essence of TDD: **Test first, develop second**.”

### **Key Takeaways**

1. **TDD reduces bugs:** Developer writes code according to pre-defined tests.
2. **Faster development:** Time spent finding defects after coding is drastically reduced.
3. **Simple approach:** A test can even be **plain English sentences**, no code needed initially.
4. **Multiple scenarios:** Each scenario can have multiple test instances to cover edge cases.
5. **Parallel thinking:** Tester and developer work in harmony; code is guided by tests.

**Mentor:**
“So, friends, **writing tests first is not just about testing**. It’s about:

* **Guiding development**
* **Reducing time and cost**
* **Increasing quality**

Just like vaccines, if you **understand the problem and write tests first**, your software development becomes **much faster, safer, and more reliable**.

Remember, TDD is **thinking ahead, planning your tests, and then coding smartly**.”

# 👨‍🏫Test-Driven Development & Test Scenarios

**Mentor:**
“Alright, friends, let’s continue our discussion on **Test-Driven Development**.

So far, we have defined our **test scenarios** for a module like **Membership Model** in an online shopping application.

Now think about this:

* You have **multiple scenarios**—User Authentication, Registration, Change Password.
* For each scenario, you define **inputs and expected outputs**.
* Example:

| Test Case | Username | Password | Expected Output |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | --------------- |
| 1         | Ravi     | seed     | True            |
| 2         | Sachin   | IBM      | False           |
| 3         | Minal    | 1234     | True            |
| 4         | Sandesh  | abcd     | False           |

 
### **Manual vs Automated Testing**

“Now, these tests can initially be **manual tests**.

* Manual testing is **time-consuming**.
* But you can also **automate these tests**. Automation allows running **hundreds of tests in seconds**, saving a lot of time.

Think of it like running blood tests in a lab: you can do it manually for a few samples, but automation lets you process **thousands efficiently**.”
 
### **Developer Perspective**

“Here’s the magic of TDD:

1. Tester writes **test cases first**.
2. Developer receives the **tests as input** and writes code that **fulfills these tests**.

Example:

* Developer writes a class called `AccountManager` with a method `Validate()`.
* Inputs: username, password.
* Expected output: boolean (true/false) depending on the test case.

```csharp
bool status = false;
if(username == "Ravi" && password == "seed")
    status = true;
else if(username == "Sachin" && password == "IBM")
    status = false;
return status;
```

* Developer **does not guess the logic**; the logic comes from **predefined test cases**.
* Each scenario leads to **if/else statements or logic blocks**, covering all test cases systematically.”

### **Collaboration Analogy**

“Think about **pharmaceutical industry**:

* Doctor → Tester (defines tests)
* Lab technician → Developer (executes logic/code)
* Pharmaceutical company → Product team

Just like in medicine, **testing is as important as development**.

* Tester guides development.
* Developer focuses on writing code that **fulfills tests**, not arbitrary code.
* This makes the software **focused, defect-free, and fast**.”

### **Career Insights**

“Some of you may choose careers as:

* Tester → like lab technician
* Developer → like doctor/chemist
* Trainer → like a mentor developing other engineers

Remember: **developing software is important**, but **developing software engineers is even more impactful**.”

### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Test Cases = Guideline:** Define input, output, and scenarios.
2. **Multiple Tests:** Each functional requirement can have multiple test instances.
3. **TDD Workflow:** Tester → Test Cases → Developer → Code → Validation.
4. **Manual → Automation:** Start simple, then automate for efficiency.
5. **Focus & Discipline:** Developer writes **only code necessary to pass tests**, saving time and reducing bugs.
6. **Career Parallel:** Like medicine, every role in software has importance—tester, developer, trainer.

**Mentor:**
“So remember friends, **software engineering is like building a lab for a vaccine**:

* You define the problem → write tests → develop code → validate → deliver high-quality software.
* Tester drives the quality, developer drives the logic, and together they **ensure the product is reliable and fast**.
