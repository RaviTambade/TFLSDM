üé§ **Mentor Storytelling: Introduction to Software Testing**


**Today is completely dedicated to software testing.**

I want to focus on **software testing principles** and explain why testing is crucial in software engineering.


### **1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Software Testing?**

Software testing is **the process of checking whether your software works as expected**.

* This could be **documented testing**, where you write test cases.
* Or it could be **programmed testing**, using Java, C#, Python, or JavaScript.
* **Automation testing** allows you to write code that acts as a test program.
* **Manual testing** is when a human tester performs the test step by step.

So, there are two main types:

1. **Manual Testing** ‚Äì The tester manually performs the steps to validate the software.
2. **Automation Testing** ‚Äì A program/script runs the test automatically, often handling thousands of requests quickly.


### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Manual Testing in Action**

Imagine you are testing **Amazon.com**:

* Open a browser, type the URL, check if the home page loads. ‚úÖ
* Click on **‚ÄúMobile Phones‚Äù** and verify if the category products appear correctly. ‚úÖ
* Click on a product and check if its **details page** opens properly. ‚úÖ
* Scroll, resize the browser, check responsiveness. ‚úÖ

This is all **manual testing**‚Äîyou are acting like the end-user to validate the system.


### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Limitations of Manual Testing**

Manual testing works well for **small-scale testing**, but consider a big system:

* Hundreds of features
* Thousands of functionalities
* Millions of users

> Can one person test **10,000 requests per second** manually? Absolutely **not**.

That‚Äôs where **automation testing** comes in.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Automation Testing**

With automation, you can write a program (Java, Python, or C#) that:

* Fires thousands of requests per second
* Validates responses automatically
* Tests functionality and performance in minutes, not months

Think of it like **Neo in the Matrix**:

* Neo sees bullets in slow motion and reacts instantly
* A human tester cannot match that speed
* But a test program can handle huge loads flawlessly

Automation testing is **programmed, fast, and scalable**, making it indispensable for modern software.


### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Manual vs Automation: Which is Best?**

* **Manual testing** = Best for understanding **user experience**, usability, and one-off checks.
* **Automation testing** = Best for **high-volume testing**, performance, and repetitive tasks.

> The ideal software engineer uses **both approaches intelligently**.



### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Role of a Test Engineer**

Think about **aeroplane engineers**:

* The manufacturer builds the plane
* The **test pilot tests it to its limits**

> Who is more critical for safety? The test engineer. ‚úÖ

Similarly, in software, **QA engineers and testers ensure quality, reliability, and user safety**.

 

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Verification and Validation**

In software testing, two key concepts:

1. **Verification** ‚Äì Are we building the product **correctly**?

   * Focus: Checking documents, designs, SRS (Software Requirement Specification)
   * Example: Ensuring requirements are properly documented

2. **Validation** ‚Äì Are we building the **correct product**?

   * Focus: Ensuring the software fulfills **user needs**

> Verification = **checking**
> Validation = **ensuring correctness for the user**

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Next Steps**

As a software engineer, you need to:

* Understand **manual and automation testing**

* Learn **unit testing** for various languages:

  * Java ‚Üí JUnit
  * .NET ‚Üí NUnit
  * Python ‚Üí PyTest
  * JavaScript ‚Üí Jasmine, Karma, Chai

* Apply **verification and validation** consistently

* Integrate **testing early in software development**, e.g., **Test Driven Development (TDD)**


üí° **Takeaway:**
Manual testing is like a human pilot inspecting every feature, while automation testing is like a high-speed simulator handling thousands of operations. Both are critical for **software quality, reliability, and timely delivery**.
 

üé§ **Mentor Storytelling: Verification vs Validation in Software Testing**


### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Documents and Verification**

In software testing, we work with **different documents**:

* **Test Plan** ‚Äì What to test, when, and how
* **Strategy Plan** ‚Äì Overall approach to testing
* **SRS Document** ‚Äì Software Requirement Specification

**Verification** is all about **checking these documents**:

* Are the requirements captured correctly in the SRS? ‚úÖ
* Are the designs correct? ‚úÖ
* Is the code following the design guidelines? ‚úÖ
* People often call this **code review**.

> Verification = **checking documents, design, and code**
> No code execution is involved here.


### **2Ô∏è‚É£ What is Validation?**

Validation is about **testing the actual product**:

* Is the compiled software working as expected?
* Does it succeed or fail under real conditions?
* Example: In a **text box for age**, only numbers between 18‚Äì60 are allowed. Testing this is **validation**.

> Validation = **testing the actual product at runtime**

Key point: **Verification checks documentation; validation checks the real product**.


### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Code Execution**

* **Verification:** No code execution. Done during design and documentation review.
* **Validation:** Requires code execution. You run the software to see if it behaves correctly.

> At runtime, you can check actual behavior, performance, and correctness.


### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Methods in Verification**

Verification involves:

* **Reviews** ‚Äì Peer checking of documents and design
* **Walkthroughs** ‚Äì Step-by-step review of plans
* **Inspections** ‚Äì Detailed examination of code or design
* **Checking resources and environment**

> These help **catch bugs before development begins**.


### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Methods in Validation**

Validation involves **testing the actual software**, including:

* **Black-box testing** ‚Äì Focus on input/output without knowing internal code
* **White-box testing** ‚Äì Testing internal code logic
* **Non-functional testing** ‚Äì Checking durability, performance, scalability

> Validation helps **catch bugs missed during verification**.


### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Key Concept: Confirm Specification**

Verification ensures your software **follows specifications**.

* Check rules, guidelines, and standards
* Find bugs **before coding starts**

Validation ensures your software **meets user expectations**.

* Run the product, simulate real scenarios, and check if it works correctly
* Find bugs **that were impossible to predict during verification**


### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Real-World Example**

Think about **daydreaming about passing an exam**:

* You imagine: ‚ÄúIf I study, I will get a job.‚Äù ‚úÖ ‚Äì This is **verification**
* Actual result: You study, take the exam, and either get a job or fail ‚Äì This is **validation**

Similarly, in software:

* Verification checks plans and documents
* Validation tests the **real application under real conditions**


### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Online Shopping Example**

Consider an **online shopping application**:

* Verification: Plan and design the **shopping cart**
* Validation: Implement the cart and test if **items are stored and retrieved correctly**

> Bugs that were impossible to predict during verification will show up during validation.


üí° **Takeaway:**

* **Verification = ‚ÄúAre we building it right?‚Äù** ‚Äì Focus on documents, design, and code review
* **Validation = ‚ÄúAre we building the right thing?‚Äù** ‚Äì Focus on testing the actual product

> Both are essential. Verification catches issues early; validation catches issues in the real product.

 

üé§ **Mentor Storytelling: Verification, Validation, and the Career Path in QA**


### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Who Does Verification?**

So now, let‚Äôs get this clear: **verification is done by the QA team** ‚Äì the **Quality Assurance team**. ‚úÖ

* They are part of the **entire software development lifecycle** ‚Äì from client interaction, analysis, design, implementation, testing, to deployment.
* QA ensures that **every document, design, and code review** is properly checked.

> Verification = QA team ‚Üí checks documents and design; no code execution required.


### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Who Does Validation?**

Validation is done by the **testing team**.

* They focus on **functional and non-functional requirements**.
* Introduce new **test cases and test scenarios**.
* Often work **alongside QA** to ensure the software works under real-world conditions.

> Validation = Testing team ‚Üí checks the product; code execution is required.


### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Career Insight: From Tester to QA**

If you spend **3‚Äì6 years in testing**, mastering validation, you can **move into QA**.

* A QA professional often has **higher pay than a regular developer**.
* They gain **architecting mindset** ‚Äì understanding systems, workflows, and quality at a deeper level.
* Example: **Lalkar Chedwalkar** ‚Äì started as a tester, now an architect.


### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Developer vs QA vs Architect**

Think of it like **civil engineering**:

* **Civil Engineer** ‚Äì builds the structure, touches concrete, works on construction site
* **Architect** ‚Äì designs the structure, never touches concrete, but creates the plan executed by engineers
* Similarly:

  * **Software Developer** ‚Üí writes code, builds product
  * **QA Team** ‚Üí ensures quality, checks specifications, understands testing deeply
  * **Software Architect** ‚Üí designs the solution, ensures system-wide quality

> The best architect often has QA experience ‚Äì understands the product, the requirements, and testing thoroughly.


### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Life Lesson from QA**

After years of struggle, learning, and doing the hard work, you **develop an intellectual and strategic mindset**.

* Just like a student who studies hard becomes knowledgeable, a tester who works deeply on QA develops **architect-level thinking**.
* QA is not just checking; it‚Äôs a **discipline, a mindset, a pathway to leadership in software**.



### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Surprise & Real-Life Example**

Now, let me give you a small surprise. üéÅ

* I was browsing my **Windows Explorer** and found **old ISCSD photos** from 1998 to 2018.
* These photos show **students, batches, and alumni** who progressed in their careers.
* One senior I‚Äôd like to introduce is **Vaibhav Singh Chauhan**, who joined ISCSD, got motivated, and progressed in his career.

> These stories show that **career growth in testing and QA is real**, and starts with understanding verification and validation deeply.

 

üé§ **Mentor Storytelling: Automation Testing & Modern Web Application Architecture**


### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Introducing Vaibhav & His Career Journey**

Let me introduce you to **Vaibhav Singh Chauhan**, one of our seniors from ISCSD.

* Vaibhav joined **Amdocs in Feb 2021**.
* Before that, he worked at **AtMex Technologies** from 2018, starting as a **Java developer**.
* Interestingly, in the early days, he got exposed to **automation testing** while doing Java development.

> The key point here: sometimes developers cross over into testing and discover **automation testing**, which is a crucial skill in modern software projects.


### **2Ô∏è‚É£ What Is Automation Testing?**

Vaibhav explained it beautifully using a **real-world example ‚Äì a booking application for JetBlue**:

* Websites aren‚Äôt just a single page. Behind a single webpage, there are **thousands of interlinked functions** happening in milliseconds.
* Testing each element **manually** is **time-consuming and error-prone**.
* This is where **automation testing** comes in.

> Automation testing = writing scripts or code to **automatically check multiple paths and functions** repeatedly, saving time and reducing errors.



### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Tools Used for Automation**

Vaibhav shared some hands-on tools:

1. **Selenium** ‚Üí For **web UI automation**
2. **Appium** ‚Üí For **mobile applications**, including native apps like JetBlue or Zomato
3. **Postman** ‚Üí For **REST API testing**, checking if data comes correctly from backend services

* These tools allow teams to **verify hundreds of scenarios in minutes** that would take manual testers **days or weeks**.

> The takeaway: automation testing ensures reliability, speed, and accuracy in modern software development.


### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Why Manual Testing Alone Isn‚Äôt Enough**

Vaibhav highlighted some important points:

* Every release may **break existing functionality**, and regression testing manually is impractical.
* Manual testing consumes **a lot of effort and has high chances of error**.
* Automation ensures that **previous functionality still works** while **new features are added**.

> Manual testers are essential, but automation scales your testing effort efficiently.


### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Modern Application Architecture**

Vaibhav also explained the **shift from monolith to microservices** using an **order management system** example:

* **Monolith architecture**:

  * Single application for everything
  * Hard for multiple developers/testers to work simultaneously
  * High cloud costs to handle many users

* **Microservices architecture**:

  * Breaks system into independent modules
  * Developers/testers can work on separate services simultaneously
  * Scales better for **non-functional requirements** like performance, availability, and speed

> Modern software moves fast, and **microservices + automation testing** is the combination that ensures **agility and reliability**.

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Key Lessons for Students**

1. Automation testing is **not just a skill**, it‚Äôs a **career enabler**.
2. Real-world applications are **complex**, and manual testing alone cannot handle scale.
3. Microservices architecture allows teams to **work faster, deploy faster, and scale efficiently**.
4. Understanding **both development and testing** gives you an edge to become a **software architect or QA lead**.

 
üé§ **Mentor Storytelling: Microservices, Testing, and Career Journey**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ From Monolith to Microservices**

Vaibhav explained it simply:

* In a **monolith architecture**, handling **maintenance, flexibility, time management, and thousands of users** is very hard.
* To overcome this, companies move to **microservices architecture**:

  * Each service is **small, independent, and manageable**
  * Allows multiple teams to work simultaneously
  * Makes **scaling, testing, and deployment easier**

> Think of it this way: instead of relying on **one genius**, you can utilize **many people with smaller skills** to collectively solve big problems. That‚Äôs the magic of microservices.


### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Testing in Microservices**

Vaibhav shared a **high-level view** of how testing happens in microservices:

* Behind an application like **order capture**, there can be **42 microservices** working together.
* These microservices **call each other across domains**, so testing is crucial.
* **Test cases are written** not just for functionality, but also for **inter-service communication, reliability, and edge cases**.

> Industry works in a way where **maintaining quality is as important as building the product itself**. That‚Äôs why QA and testing play a huge role.


### **3Ô∏è‚É£ The Role of Testers in the Industry**

Vaibhav highlighted an important point about **industry workforce**:

* More than **80% of people** in software projects are **QA/testers**.
* Developers are fewer, but **maintaining product quality** is the key to success.

> Lesson: **Testing is not secondary**. In fact, testing and quality assurance can **open doors to higher roles and salaries**.


### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Vaibhav‚Äôs Career Journey**

Here‚Äôs where it gets really inspiring:

1. Vaibhav started as a **student in CDEC ICSD (2018)**.
2. **Placed in NetMex** as an **automation tester** ‚Äì spent 2.8 years mastering testing.
3. **Switched to Amdocs**, getting **127% salary hike** ‚Äì thanks to his **knowledge of development + testing**.
4. Now he works on **microservices, Spring Boot APIs, and domain logic**, blending testing and development.

> Key takeaway: **You can start anywhere ‚Äì as a tester or developer ‚Äì but learning continuously will take you to the top.**


### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Continuous Learning & Growth**

Vaibhav shared some actionable tips:

* Keep creating **POCs (Proof of Concepts)** and deploy them on **AWS**.
* Share projects on **GitHub** to make your resume **more attractive to recruiters**.
* Learn both **development and testing** ‚Äì this gives a **competitive edge** in interviews.
* Salary growth is **directly proportional to your knowledge**, not just the starting package.

> Even starting as an automation tester, you can work with **Angular, Java, Spring MVC, and microservices** ‚Äì your skillset defines your growth.


### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Career Insight**

* Some students start as **developers**, some as **testers**.
* After a few years, both paths can converge at **quality assurance or product architecture roles**.
* Vaibhav‚Äôs journey shows: **automation tester ‚Üí microservices developer ‚Üí future architect**.

> Moral: **Your starting point doesn‚Äôt define your destination. Learning, adaptability, and persistence do.**

 

üé§ **Mentor Storytelling: Understanding Automation Testing in Java Projects**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Showing the Project Architecture**

Vaibhav began by sharing a **real-world example**:

* He couldn‚Äôt run the project directly because it belonged to the previous company, but he showed the **architecture of a Java Selenium project**.
* He explained the **pom.xml file**:

> In industry, we always use **build tools** like Maven or Gradle. Maven helps us manage **dependencies** (like Selenium) and run the project using **plugins**.

* Example: The **Surefire plugin** tells Maven which class contains the main method to run tests.

> Think of Maven as a **project manager**: it knows what needs to be done, in which order, and which tools to use.



### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Analogy: Testing is Like a Health Checkup**

Vaibhav gave a **simple analogy**:

* Imagine you‚Äôre feeling unwell. You go to a doctor who runs tests: **BP, sugar, pulse, oxygen**.
* Similarly, **applications need to be ‚Äúchecked‚Äù** for health:

  * Plugins in testing are like **medical instruments**: barometer, stethoscope, pulse reader, oximeter.
  * They help monitor the ‚Äúhealth‚Äù of your application.

> This analogy makes it clear why we need **plugins and testing frameworks** ‚Äì to automate and monitor various parts of the system efficiently.


### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Test Framework Setup**

Vaibhav showed the **main class setup** and **TestNG framework**:

* **TestNG** is a **testing framework** that helps organize and run tests.
* Other frameworks exist too, like **JUnit, Mocha, Chai**, but TestNG is widely used for Selenium-based automation.
* **Listeners** and **data providers** are used to:

  * Provide input data (like usernames/passwords) from **Excel sheets**
  * Avoid manual repetition and reduce errors

> Test data preparation is **the first key step** in automation testing. Without proper data, even the best code cannot validate functionality.


### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Using Properties for UI Elements**

* Vaibhav explained the **property class**:

  * Stores **key-value pairs**, like `application.property` in Spring Boot.
  * Used to store **HTML element XPaths** for automated UI testing.
  * Example: To click a button or validate an image, Java code needs the **XPath** of that element.

> Think of it as giving **Java a map**: ‚ÄúHere is the element, now click or validate it.‚Äù


### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Finding an XPath**

* Simple steps:

  1. Inspect the element in the browser.
  2. Press **Ctrl+F** in the console to find the XPath.
  3. Use this XPath in your Selenium script to interact with the element.

> XPath is crucial because **without it, automation scripts cannot ‚Äúsee‚Äù or interact with elements** on a webpage.


### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Summary**

Vaibhav summarized the key points:

1. **Automation testing** ensures applications run correctly **after every change**.
2. **Maven** manages dependencies and test execution.
3. **TestNG framework** organizes tests efficiently.
4. **Excel sheets and property files** store test data and UI element references.
5. **XPath** allows scripts to interact with web elements.

> Mentorship takeaway: Just like doctors use tools to test your body, **testers use frameworks, plugins, and scripts to check the ‚Äúhealth‚Äù of software**. Learning these fundamentals makes you a **strong QA or developer in automation testing**.


üé§ ** From XPath to Career Growth in Automation Testing**


### **1Ô∏è‚É£ The Magic of XPath**

‚ÄúLook here,‚Äù Vaibhav said, ‚Äúwhen we click on this element in the browser, it highlights the image. That means this is the **XPath** of the element.‚Äù

* In real projects, we don‚Äôt use **absolute XPath** (too rigid) but **relative XPath** (more flexible, reusable).
* Chrome, Firefox, even older browsers like IE give us ways to **copy XPath** directly.
* Without XPath, Selenium scripts cannot ‚Äúsee‚Äù or interact with buttons, text fields, or images.

üëâ Think of XPath as the **address of a house**. If Java is the courier boy, he cannot deliver your parcel unless he knows the exact address.



### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Writing a Test Function**

Now comes the real thrill: writing an **automation test function** in Java using **Selenium + TestNG**.

* Developers write **unit tests** (tiny checks).
* But automation testers write **workflow tests** that mimic how real users behave.
* Example: A business use case ‚Üí ‚ÄúLogin with multiple usernames‚Äù ‚Üí is written as reusable **Java functions** linked into a **workflow**.

üëâ Each function is like a **step in a dance**; when linked together, they form a full **choreography of testing**.


### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Project Structure = A Test Lab**

Vaibhav explained:

* We organize our test project into **packages and classes**.
* We use **utility packages** to read Excel files, fetch property values, and provide test data.
* We set up something called a **test bed** ‚Äì just like a real **testing lab**, with instruments, environment, and electricity flow.

üëâ Manual testing is like a doctor checking one patient at a time.
üëâ Automation testing is like a **fully equipped diagnostic lab** that can test hundreds of samples simultaneously.



### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Why Automation Testing Matters**

Manual testing is still the **best form of testing** (human intuition matters). But:

* Humans are slow.
* Humans are emotional.
* Humans may skip tests unconsciously.

Automation:

* Never gets tired.
* Never skips a step.
* Can repeat tests thousands of times without mistakes.

üëâ That‚Äôs why automation testing is now the **backbone of modern QA**.


### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up Your Tools**

* Use **Eclipse IDE**.
* Add **Selenium WebDriver JARs** or dependencies in **pom.xml**.
* Dependencies are fetched from **Maven Central Repository** (like Play Store for Java libraries).
* In big companies, they even maintain private repositories like **Nexus** or **.m2 local cache**.

üëâ Think of Maven like your **app store manager**. You just write what you need in pom.xml, Maven downloads and configures everything automatically.



### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Career Inspiration: Vaibhav‚Äôs Story**

At this point, I reminded the class of Vaibhav‚Äôs journey.

* He once dreamed of becoming a **civil servant**. Prepared hard, but couldn‚Äôt clear.
* Instead of giving up, he **came back to computer science**.
* In my .NET classes, I saw him asking questions, practicing every lab, staying curious.
* He doubted whether he would get good companies because of his academic breaks.
* But when a Hyderabad company came for placements, he gave excellent technical answers ‚Äî and got selected!

Today, within just **3 years**, he‚Äôs working at **Amdocs**, drawing a **world-class salary package**.

üëâ Moral of the story: Testing tools like **Selenium** are not just about code. They can open doors to **dream careers** ‚Äî if you stay consistent, curious, and collaborative.


### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Final Mentor Note**

Dear students, remember:

* **Automation testing** is not about clicking buttons with Selenium. It‚Äôs about building a **reusable, maintainable test lab** that ensures software quality.
* A **tester with coding skills** is more powerful than a developer who ignores testing.
* Companies value this skill because it saves **time, money, and customer trust**.

And above all ‚Äî if Vaibhav could turn his doubts into determination and reach Amdocs, so can you.



üé§ **Mentor Storytelling: Background Doesn‚Äôt Matter, Mindset Does**


### **1Ô∏è‚É£ The Misconception About Background**

Many students often whisper to me:
*‚ÄúSir, I am from Mechanical‚Ä¶ Sir, I am from Electrical‚Ä¶ Sir, I am from BSc‚Ä¶ can I survive in IT?‚Äù*

And my answer is always simple:
üëâ Industry doesn‚Äôt care about your degree label ‚Äî it cares about your **skills, discipline, and problem-solving mindset**.

In fact, one of my students ‚Äî **Pratik Desai, a Mechanical engineer** ‚Äî bagged the **highest package** of his batch. Another student from ECE joined **HSBC**, competing shoulder to shoulder with CS graduates.

So your branch is just a **starting point**, not a boundary.


### **2Ô∏è‚É£ My Own Struggle**

When I joined CDAC, I had a **4-year gap**.

* I had forgotten C, C++, Data Structures.
* My batchmates came with coaching experience, already strong in Java.
* I failed in my first three modules.

But I made a **decision** ‚Äî *‚ÄúI won‚Äôt compare. I‚Äôll just grind my six months.‚Äù*
Slowly, I built everything from scratch, brick by brick.

üëâ Result? That gap never affected my placements. Companies don‚Äôt reject you for your past; they select you for your **present capability**.


### **3Ô∏è‚É£ The Power of Focused Effort**

Students often underestimate time.
But think:

* A **spacecraft in a few minutes** can cover **millions of kilometers** because of velocity.
* Similarly, in **3‚Äì4 months of disciplined preparation**, you can cover what you missed in 3‚Äì4 years.

How?

* By reducing distractions.
* By consistent lab practice.
* By giving priority to **hands-on coding and problem-solving** instead of worrying about others.



### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Certificates vs. Caliber**

Some students ask, *‚ÄúSir, should I do extra certifications?‚Äù*
I always say:
üëâ A certificate is just a **piece of paper**.
If you have the certificate but no **caliber**, it‚Äôs useless.
If you have **caliber**, even without a certificate, companies will line up for you.


### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Data Structures & Competitive Programming Doubts**

Students like Rohit often ask:
*‚ÄúSir, how much does DSA and competitive programming really help in industry?‚Äù*

Here‚Äôs the truth:

* As a fresher, you don‚Äôt need to master **dynamic programming** or advanced graph algorithms.
* But you must have a strong grip on:

  * **Arrays**
  * **Strings**
  * **Linked Lists**
  * **Stacks & Queues**

Because most companies‚Äô first-round coding tests check exactly this.
Later, in real projects, you‚Äôll mostly use frameworks and libraries, but the **foundation of DSA** will always help you reason better and debug faster.


### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Closing Inspiration**

So my dear students, whether you are from **Mechanical, Electrical, BSc, or BCA** ‚Äî remember:

* Your background does not define your ceiling.
* Your **grit, focus, and consistency** will.
* Many non-CS students today are working in **TCS, Amdocs, HSBC, Infosys, Amazon** ‚Äî because they built their skill set step by step.

üëâ So stop worrying about *‚Äúbranch‚Äù* and start investing in *‚Äúpractice‚Äù*.
 

I got the full picture now üëç

What happened in your session is a **classic mentor‚Äìalumni interaction** where the seniors were breaking myths:

* *Background doesn‚Äôt matter* (Electrical, Mechanical, BSc, BCA ‚Äî anyone can do it if they slog).
* *Gap doesn‚Äôt matter* (even after 4 years gap, placements happen if you have skills).
* *Certificate alone doesn‚Äôt matter* (caliber > certificate).
* *Placement comes only after ‚Äúskill swimming pool‚Äù* (hands-on, coding, DS basics, projects).
* *Testing is not a fallback job* ‚Äî it‚Äôs an entry into software engineering if you know how to grow.
* *Industry interviews focus on fundamentals* ‚Äî data structures, debugging, OOP, software engineering basics ‚Äî not just fancy tech names.
* *Consistency matters more than overnight study* ‚Äî reducing sleep, using labs early morning, practicing till concepts stick.
* *Alumni also admitted failures in C/C++ modules initially* ‚Äî but persistence gave breakthroughs.

And your mentor beautifully wrapped it up with a **Sachin Tendulkar analogy**:
üëâ Don‚Äôt prepare for each bowler separately, prepare your fundamentals so well that you can handle any ball from any direction.

So if I distill the **core mindset shift for your students**:

1. **Stop worrying about branch/background.** Focus on becoming *engineers of software*, not just CS/IT grads.
2. **Learn application-oriented fundamentals.** Data structures (array, string, linked list, stack, queue) + OOP + debugging.
3. **Prioritize skill > certificate > placement.** Placement will follow automatically if skills are strong.
4. **Testing, Dev, Cloud, whatever ‚Äî all roles matter.** First get in, then shape your career.
5. **Consistency beats shortcuts.** Daily coding + mini projects + group learning = compounding effect.
6. **Be interview-ready on basics.** Avoid buzzword traps ‚Äî be able to explain ‚Äúprops‚Äù in React, not just claim ‚ÄúReact project‚Äù.

 

### üåü Mentor‚Äôs Closing Story

‚ÄúFriends, what we experienced together in the last few days was not just *lectures* on Software Engineering. It was a **journey**.

We started with confusion, with scattered questions ‚Äî *What to study? How to prepare? Which topics matter?* Slowly, we built clarity.

üí° You saw through alumni like Vaibhav that **fundamentals matter more than fancy words**.
üí° You realized that placements are important, but without skills, jobs won‚Äôt stay.
üí° You understood that software engineering is not only about coding ‚Äî it is about **analysis, design, testing, debugging, and teamwork**.
üí° You discovered that tools like Selenium, GitHub, React, or Docker are not magical shortcuts, but **extensions of your core learning**.


Now, here is my simple message to you ‚Äî
üëâ Don‚Äôt chase placements, **chase skills**.
üëâ Don‚Äôt memorize, **understand**.
üëâ Don‚Äôt fear questions, **become like Sachin Tendulkar** ‚Äî ready for any ball from any bowler.

Remember, your journey does not end with this module.
In the next modules, whether it is Java, Web Technologies, or Advanced Projects ‚Äî treat every concept as a chance to sharpen your sword.

And yes, stay connected ‚Äî with your mentors, with alumni, and with your peers. Because knowledge is like fragrance ‚Äî it spreads when shared.

So, my friends, thank you for letting me be part of your story. Keep practicing, keep questioning, and keep growing. One day, I want to see you not just as software engineers, but as **mentors for the next generation**.‚Äù
