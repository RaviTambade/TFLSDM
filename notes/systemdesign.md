## System Desing Thinking terms

👨‍🏫 **Mentor (You):**
Om, when we talk about system design, think of yourself as a *city planner*. Imagine you’re building a city for millions of people. Now tell me — if a city is poorly designed, what happens?

👦 **Om (Mentee):**
Sir, there will be traffic jams, electricity problems, water shortages — basically chaos.

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:**
Exactly. The same happens in software. If you don’t design it properly, users face crashes, delays, and bad experiences. That’s why we learn **system design fundamentals**.

Let’s break it layer by layer.

### 🛜 Networking (Roads & Traffic)

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:**
Om, how does your browser know where “google.com” lives?

👦 **Om:**
Through DNS, right? It converts the name into an IP.

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:**
Perfect. And when millions of users hit Google, what prevents one server from burning out?

👦 **Om:**
A load balancer distributes requests.

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:**
Yes! And for faster delivery, we keep copies of data near users — that’s CDN.
      

### 💾 Storage (Granaries & Libraries)

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:**
Suppose you’re designing Instagram. Photos are huge. Would you store them in SQL tables?

👦 **Om:**
No, sir. SQL is good for structured data. Photos I’d put in Object Storage like S3.

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:**
Correct! And to serve feeds quickly?

👦 **Om:**
Use caching like Redis.

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:**
Bingo. Now you’re thinking like a system designer.

### 🖥️ Compute (Factories)

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:**
Tell me, Om — what’s the difference between a VM and a Container?

👦 **Om:**
VMs are heavier, each with its own OS. Containers share the OS kernel, so they’re lightweight and portable.

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:**
Exactly. And Serverless?

👦 **Om:**
That’s like running code only when triggered, no server management.

### 📡 Communication (Post & Calls)

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:**
Imagine WhatsApp. What enables live chat?

👦 **Om:**
WebSockets, sir — real-time two-way connection.

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:**
Yes. And if one service sends messages asynchronously?

👦 **Om:**
That’s Message Queue.

### 🏗️ Architecture Patterns (City Layouts)

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:**
Netflix uses which style, Om?

👦 **Om:**
Microservices. Each service for movies, recommendations, payments.

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:**
Good. And small startups?

👦 **Om:**
They usually start with Monoliths — easier and faster to build.

### 🎯 Closing
👨‍🏫 **Mentor:**
So Om, remember:
* System design is like telling a story with trade-offs.
* For *100 users*, maybe a monolith and SQL DB are enough.
* For *1M users*, you need load balancers, caches, sharding, microservices.

👦 **Om:**
Sir, I get it now. It’s not about throwing fancy terms — it’s about **choosing the right tool for the scale and the problem**.

👨‍🏫 **Mentor:**
That’s the spirit. If you explain like this in interviews, you’ll stand out.
